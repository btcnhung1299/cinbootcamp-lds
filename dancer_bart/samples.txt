the mass of the neutralino is mainly controlled by three parameters , the bino mass @xmath5 , wino mass @xmath6 , and higgsino mass @xmath7 . since two of them , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are related to chargino masses , they must be larger than @xmath8 gev to satisfy their lep mass bounds . therefore , the only possibility is to take @xmath9 gev to obtain the light neutralino . consequently , the lightest neutralino in this scenario becomes mostly bino . the model that we deal with is described by the following nine parameters : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined as the ratio of the two higgs vev s , @xmath12 is the gluino mass , @xmath13 is the universal coefficient for tri - linear scalar couplings , @xmath14 is the cp - odd higgs mass , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the common soft susy breaking masses for squarks and sleptons , respectively . we scan them to search for the parameter region in which the light neutralino dm scenario is consistent with the particle physics observations . we assume that the neutralino was thermally produced in the early universe . since such a light particle is overproduced in the thermal process , an efficient annihilation process is necessary to reproduce the correct relic density . there are two main annihilation processes for light neutralino dm : sfermion mediation and cp - odd higgs mediation . it is known that the parameter space in which sfermion mediation becomes the main annihilation process can not be consistent with the results suggested by dama / libra , cogent and cresst  @xcite ( see also ref . therefore , following ref . @xcite , we adopt the higgs mediation process as the main annihilation process . in order to enhance the higgs - mediated annihilation , the following three conditions are required of the model parameters : ( i ) light @xmath17 , ( ii ) small @xmath7 to have a significant amount of higgsino component in the lightest neutralino , and ( iii ) large @xmath18 to enhance the main annihilation process to a @xmath19 pair . this parameter choice enhances not only the annihilation process but also many flavour physics processes . in addition , it magnifies the signal of neutral higgs bosons decaying to lepton pairs at hadron colliders . therefore , one must carefully inspect the compatibility in the parameter choice between the cosmological requirements and the particle physics constraints . we employ the following flavour physics processes and categorize them into two groups by their parameter dependence :    * * group i : * @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . they essentially depend only on higgs parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath18 . * * group ii : * @xmath25 and @xmath26 . these processes depend not only on the higgs parameters but also on the susy parameters such as @xmath15 and @xmath13 . group i observables complemetarily constrain the parameter space of @xmath24 and @xmath18 , which are regardless of the detail of the susy parameters  @xcite . the key observables are @xmath27 and @xmath23 . we adopt the following values @xmath28 as the allowed range of these observables . @xmath27 excludes intermediate values of @xmath18 . on the other hand , @xmath23 disfavours larger values of @xmath18 . therefore , the allowed parameter region with middle - to - high values of @xmath18 is sharply narrowed by combination of these two constraints . after a numerical scan of the parameters eq . , we found that the allowed parameter regions form two separated clusters : ( i ) a narrow strip at high @xmath18 ( @xmath29 ) and ( ii ) a low @xmath18 region ( @xmath30 ) . the mass of the lightest neutralino is inversely proportional to @xmath18 , because a lighter neutralino requires a more efficient annihilation process that is enhanced by a large value of @xmath18 . as shown in the left plot of fig . [ fig1 ] , a neutralino with mass lighter than 15 gev is viable only on the high @xmath18 strip . next , we discuss the neutralino - nucleon scattering cross - section . dama / libra and cogent suggest relatively large values for the cross - section . in both parameter regions ( i ) and ( ii ) , the neutralino - nucleon scattering process is mediated by higgs bosons , and its parameter dependence is similar to that of the neutralino annihilation process . consequently , the direct detection cross - section becomes large at the light neutralino region on which a large annihilation cross - section is required . as shown in the right plot in fig .

[ lemma : input var polarity ] let @xmath91 be the cnf decomposition of a consistency checker @xmath28 . there exists a polynomial size cnf decomposition @xmath163 of @xmath28 such that negative literals of the input variables do not appear in any clause in @xmath163 . we construct @xmath163 by removing from @xmath91 all clauses that contain a negative literal of an input variable . we show by contradiction that unit propagation on @xmath163 and @xmath91 produces identical results for the output variable @xmath93 . let @xmath137 be a partial instantiation of the input variables such that unit propagation on @xmath91 under @xmath137 sets @xmath93 to falsebut leaves @xmath93 unset on @xmath163 . since unit propagation on @xmath91 and @xmath163 produces different results , at least one of the removed clauses becomes unit under @xmath137 in @xmath91 . by definition , @xmath91 never forces any literal of an input variable , so for any removed clause to become unit , all the literals of input variables in it have to be false . since at least one of these literals is negative , at least one input variable has to be set to truein @xmath137 . we construct another partial instantiation @xmath141 from @xmath137 by setting the same literals to falseas @xmath137 and leaving the rest unset , i.e. , @xmath164 . the partial instantiations @xmath137 and @xmath141 represent the same domains @xmath7 , because the mapping from partial instantiation to domain depends only on the literals that are false . by this and the fact that @xmath91 is a decomposition of @xmath28 , unit propagation on @xmath91 under @xmath141 forces the output variable @xmath93 to the same value as under @xmath137 , false . consider the result of unit propagation on @xmath163 under @xmath141 . recall that by definition @xmath91 does not modify input variables and @xmath141 does not have literal set to trueby construction . hence , none of the clauses that we remove from @xmath91 to get @xmath163 can become unit after performing up on @xmath91 under @xmath141 . hence , unit propagation in @xmath163 under @xmath141 sets @xmath93 to falseas in @xmath91 . on the other hand , @xmath137 sets a superset of the literals that @xmath141 sets , so unit propagation on @xmath163 under @xmath137 also sets @xmath93 to false , a contradiction , since we assumed that @xmath163 leaves @xmath93 unset under @xmath137 .    in practice , a cnf decomposition of a consistency checker may not be self contained and may depend on the existence of clauses in the direct encoding of variable domains . in this case , we can not just remove clauses that contain negative literals of input variables , as lemma  [ lemma : input var polarity ] suggests . however , using the clauses of the direct encoding , we can substitute negative literals with the disjunction of positive literals . for instance , consider a variable @xmath90 with the domain @xmath165 and a clause @xmath166 in @xmath91 . the literal @xmath167 can make this clause unit . the direct encoding of @xmath168 includes a clause @xmath169 . note that the literal @xmath167 is trueif and only if literals @xmath170 and @xmath171 are false . therefore , the literal @xmath172 can be replaced with the disjunction @xmath173 and the clause @xmath166 is transformed to the clause @xmath174 . the next step is to show that we can transform a cnf decomposition so that each auxiliary variable is unset or falsefor _ all _ inputs that make the output variable false . the transformation is a renaming of the auxiliary variables . lemma  [ lemma : extra_var_values ] describes the property that allows this transformation . [ lemma : extra_var_values ] let @xmath91 be a cnf decomposition of a consistency checker @xmath28 over the variables @xmath175 , @xmath176 be the propositional representations of any two domain settings such that unit propagation on @xmath91 forces @xmath93 to falseunder both @xmath177 and @xmath178 . for any variable @xmath179 , if @xmath143 is forced to false(true ) by unit propagation under @xmath177 then it is not forced to true(false ) by unit propagation under @xmath178 . let a variable @xmath143 be forced to trueby unit propagation under @xmath177 and to falseunder @xmath178 , but @xmath93 is falseunder both @xmath177 and @xmath178 . consider the partial instantiation @xmath137 such that if a variable @xmath180 is falsein either @xmath177 or @xmath178 , it is also falsein @xmath137 , otherwise it is unset . since @xmath137 fixes a superset of the literals that are fixed in either @xmath177 or @xmath178 , all clauses that became unit by either @xmath177 or @xmath178 will also be unit in @xmath137 . therefore , unit propagation under @xmath137 will force at least the union of the sets of literals forced by @xmath177 and @xmath178 . this means that unit propagation under @xmath137 will make both @xmath143 and @xmath181 true , which generates the empty clause . this is a contradiction , as @xmath91 can never produce the empty clause . [ cor : extra_var_false ] a cnf decomposition @xmath91 of a consistency checker @xmath28 over variables @xmath182 , can be polynomially converted into a decomposition @xmath163 of @xmath28 such that every variable in @xmath72 is either unset or falsewhen @xmath93 is false . we construct @xmath163 from @xmath91 by flipping the polarity of those variables that are set to truewhen @xmath93 is false . lemma  [ lemma : input var polarity ] and corollary  [ cor : extra_var_false ] allow us to precisely characterize the form of the clauses in a cnf decomposition . [ lemma : anti - horn ] let @xmath91 be a cnf decomposition of a consistency checker @xmath28 . the variables of @xmath91 can be renamed so that each clause has exactly one negative literal .    by lemma  [ lemma : input var polarity ] , all input variables are positive literals in the decomposition and by definition [ defn : cnf - decomposition ] they are never forced by unit propagation on @xmath91 . in addition , by corollary  [ cor : extra_var_false ] , we can rename the auxiliary variables so that unit propagation on @xmath91 may only ever set them to false . then , in any clause that consists of input variables and one auxiliary variable @xmath143 , @xmath143 must be negative , otherwise it may be set to true , a contradiction . suppose there exists a clause @xmath183 with two auxiliary variables @xmath88 and @xmath100 and both are negative in @xmath183 . since neither @xmath88 nor @xmath100 can ever be made true , this clause can never become unit and can be ignored . suppose the literals of both @xmath88 and @xmath100 are positive in @xmath183 . then , if @xmath183 becomes unit , it makes one of the auxiliary variables true , a contradiction . thus , exactly one of the literals of @xmath88 and @xmath100 is negative in @xmath183 . the same reasoning can be extended to clauses with more than two auxiliary variables . the condition described by corollary  [ lemma : anti - horn ] is similar to @xmath91 being re - nameable anti - horn , but is stronger as it requires _ exactly _ one negative literal in each clause , rather than at most one . this condition allows us to build a monotone circuit from a decomposition , using the construction of the next lemma . [ lemma : cnf - to - mc ] let @xmath91 be a cnf decomposition of a consistency checker @xmath28 . then , there exists a monotone circuit @xmath136 of size @xmath184 that computes @xmath28 . +    we assume that @xmath91 is in the form described in corollary  [ lemma : anti - horn ] . the inputs of the circuit correspond to the input variables of @xmath91 . for each input variable @xmath38 of @xmath91 , there exists an input @xmath65 of @xmath136 which is 0 if @xmath38 is falseand 1 otherwise . internal gates of the circuit correspond to auxiliary variables after a certain number of unit propagation steps , using the same mapping . we create a circuit with @xmath185 _ layers _ @xmath186 . let @xmath187 be the clauses of @xmath91 . the @xmath188 layer of the circuit contains an @xmath189 for each clause @xmath190 , called _ clause gates _ and an @xmath191 for each auxiliary variable @xmath192 , called _ variable gates_. consider a clause @xmath190 which contains @xmath181 as the sole negative literal ( recall that corollary  [ lemma : anti - horn ] ensures that this is the case ) , the positive literals of input variables @xmath193 and the positive literals of auxiliary variables @xmath194 . the inputs of each gate @xmath195 are @xmath196 and @xmath197 . let the clauses with @xmath198 as the sole negative literal be @xmath199 . then , the inputs of each gate @xmath191 are @xmath200 . the output of the circuit is @xmath201 . note that in this construction the inputs of some the gates may not be defined . this is the case , for example , for the gate @xmath202 , where the clause @xmath203 contains the positive literals of some auxiliary variables . if this happens for a clause gate , we omit it , while if it happens for a variable gate , we omit the undefined input . if all the inputs of a variable gate are undefined , we omit the gate . this construction computes one breadth first application of unit propagation at each layer . specifically , the gate @xmath191 is 0 iff @xmath192 is forced to falseafter @xmath64 or fewer breadth first steps of unit propagation , while the gate @xmath189 is 0 iff the negated variable in @xmath190 is forced to falseafter @xmath64 or fewer breadth first steps of unit propagation . we show this by induction . for the first layer , there exist gates only for clauses with no positive literals of auxiliary variables . consider any such gate @xmath190 which contains the negative literal @xmath198 . all the propositional variables in @xmath190 except @xmath192 are false iff the corresponding inputs are 0 . thus @xmath204 is 0 iff @xmath192 is falseafter unit propagation of @xmath190 . if many clauses contain the negative literal @xmath198 , then at least one of them sets @xmath192 to falsein one breadth first step iff there exists a clause gate that is 0 and is an input to the variable gate @xmath205 , which is an and is thus 0 . for the inductive step , assume that the layers @xmath206 compute @xmath207 breadth first steps of unit propagation . the same reasoning as for the base case shows that the results of unit propagation are correctly computed for the @xmath208 layer . note that the @xmath208 layer may also contain gates that were omitted at previous levels . since the inputs of these gates are correctly computed by the inductive hypothesis , the gates that are new to the @xmath208 layer are also correctly computed .    to conclude the proof , observe that in the extreme case , unit propagation will set one more literal at every breadth first step , thus after @xmath185 steps it must either arrive at a fixpoint or set all literals . since the circuit has @xmath185 layers , it will correctly compute the result of unit propagation on @xmath91 . we illustrate the construction of lemma  [ lemma : cnf - to - mc ] with an example . [ ex : cnf - to - mc ] consider the cnf decomposition @xmath209 , where @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 . we construct a monotone circuit @xmath136 from @xmath91 , ( figure  [ fig : good_circuit ] ) . for a given instantiation of the input variables , this circuit computes 0 for the corresponding boolean inputs if and only if unit propagation on @xmath91 forces the output variable to false . the circuit consists of 3 layers , with gates 1 and 2 in the first layer , 38 in the second and gate 9 in the third . the gates 16 and 9 are clause gates , while gates 7 and 8 are variable gates . a strict application of the construction of lemma  [ lemma : cnf - to - mc ] would also have variable gates in layers 1 and 3 , but we omit them here as they would be single - input gates . note that in figure  [ fig : good_circuit ] , inputs are replicated at each layer to reduce clutter . we note also that the layered construction of lemma  [ lemma : cnf - to - mc ] is necessary . a circuit that attempts to capture unit propagation on all clauses without using layers would have to contain a cycle between the gates that compute @xmath88 and @xmath100 , because @xmath88 would need to be an input of the clause gate @xmath215 that computes @xmath100 and @xmath100 would need to an input of the clause gate @xmath216 that computes @xmath88 . constructing a layered circuit allows us to remove such cycles . the proof of theorem  [ thm : cnf_mc_equiv ] is now immediate from lemmas  [ lemma : mc_cnf ] and [ lemma : cnf - to - mc ] . since cnf decompositions of consistency checkers can be converted in polynomial time to and from cnf decompositions of propagators , theorem  [ thm : cnf_mc_equiv ] also holds for propagators .", "corollary  [ cor : alldiff ] now uses an existing circuit complexity result to show that , unsurprisingly , there is no polynomial size cnf decomposition of the domain consistency propagator for the constraint . this also applies to generalizations of , such as . [ cor : alldiff ] there is no polynomial sized cnf decomposition of the domain consistency propagator . rgin  @xcite showed that an constraint has a solution iff the corresponding bipartite value graph ( i.e. , the graph where the node representing a variable has an edge to every node that represents a value in its domain ) has a perfect matching . in addition , every bipartite graph corresponds to the value graph of an constraint and dc propagators detect dis - entailment . thus , if there exists a polynomial size cnf decomposition of the dc propagator , we can construct a monotone circuit that computes whether a bipartite graph has a perfect matching . but razborov  @xcite showed that the smallest monotone circuit that computes whether there exists a perfect matching for a bipartite graph is super - polynomial in the number of vertices in the graph . therefore , the smallest cnf decomposition of the dc propagator is super - polynomial in size . on the other hand , bound and range consistency propagators of can be decomposed , as we argue in  @xcite .", "in this paper we have shown how the tools of circuit complexity can be used to study decompositions of global propagators into cnf . our results directly extend to decompositions into csp constraints of bounded arity with domains given in extension since such decompositions can be translated into clauses of polynomial size . an interesting next step is to consider the decomposability of constraint propagators into more expressive primitive constraints where domains are represented in logarithmic space via their bounds . csp solvers provide this feature which is missing in cnf . we conjecture that there exists an equivalence between such csp decompositions of constraint propagators and monotone arithmetic circuits that are generalizations of boolean monotone circuits to real numbers and gates for addition and multiplication . since lower bound results on monotone circuits usually transfer to monotone arithmetic circuits , this would imply that the domain consistency propagator for can not be decomposed to constraints that exploit ( exponentially ) large domains .                c. bessiere , e. hebrard , b. hnich , z. kiziltan and t. walsh . the range constraint : algorithms and implementation . in _ 3rd int . conf . on integration of ai and or techniques in cp ( cp - ai - or ) _ , 5973 , 2006 .          c. bessiere , g. katsirelos , n. narodytska , c .- g . quimper and t. walsh . decompositions of all different , global cardinality and related constraints . in _ joint conf . on ai _ , 2009 . s. brand , n. narodytska , c .- g . quimper , p. stuckey and t. walsh . encodings of the sequence constraint . in _ 13th int . conf . on principles and practice of cp ( cp2007 ) _ , 210224 ."]}

the length of the representation of the element . the time that the algorithm takes before giving the first element is called the _ preprocessing time_. the time of finding the next element is called

aperiodic word . 2 .   given an aperiodic word @xmath51 , the irreducible polynomial @xmath56 can be constructed in time ] @xmath57 . obviously , the aperiodic word @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 corresponds to the same irreducible polynomial . see  ( [ pk ] ) . that is , @xmath62 for any @xmath63 . therefore to avoid enumerating the same polynomial more than once , the algorithm

in the next section , we show how to enumerate all the lyndon words of length @xmath0 in linear delay time @xmath67 . then from @xmath55 ( that corresponds to an irreducible polynomial ) the algorithm constructs the irreducible polynomial @xmath68 and all the other @xmath27 roots in quadratic time  @xmath69 . since the size of all the roots is @xmath70 , this complexity is quasilinear in the output

@xmath0 . we have shown how to reduce our problem to the problem of enumerating all the lyndon words over @xmath3 of length @xmath0 with linear delay time . algorithm `` enumerate '' in figure  [ alg

the lyndon word is an array of symbols . all the analyses of the algorithms in the literature treat an access to an element in an @xmath0 element array and comparing it to another symbol as an operation of time complexity equal to  @xmath114 . the complexity of incrementing / decrementing an index @xmath115 of an array of length @xmath0 and comparing two such indices are not included in the

duval in @xcite gave a linear time algorithm . in this subsection , we give a simple algorithm that decides membership in linear time . to this end , we need to introduce the suffix tree data structure . the suffix tree of a word @xmath208 is a trie that contains all the suffixes of @xmath208 . see for example the suffix tree of the word @xmath209 in figure  [ suffixtree ] . a suffix tree of a word @xmath208 of length @xmath0 can be constructed in linear time in @xmath0  @xcite . using the suffix tree , one can check if a word @xmath210 of length @xmath211 is a suffix of @xmath208 in time @xmath212 . denote by @xmath213 the suffix tree of @xmath208 . define any order @xmath7 on the symbols of @xmath208 . define min@xmath214 as follows : start from the root of the trie and follow , at each node , the edges with the minimal symbol . then min@xmath214 is the word that corresponds to this path . one can find this word in @xmath213 in time that is linear in its length . the function @xmath215 defines the following total order @xmath216 on the suffixes : let @xmath217 . take @xmath218 as the minimum element in that order . now remove this word from @xmath219 and take @xmath218 as the next one in that order . repeat the above until the tree is empty . for example , if @xmath220 then the order in the suffix tree in figure  [ suffixtree ] is @xmath221 obviously , for two suffixes @xmath208 and @xmath222 , @xmath223 if and only if for @xmath224 we have @xmath225 ( in the lexicographic order ) . we define @xmath226 the suffix tree of the suffixes of @xmath208 of length at least @xmath227 . we can construct @xmath226 in linear time in @xmath228 by taking a walk in the suffix tree @xmath213 and remove all the words of length less than @xmath227 . in the same way as above , we define @xmath229 . the algorithm is in figure  [ alg02 ] . we use lemma  [ cond01 ] . the algorithm constructs the trie @xmath235 . the construction takes linear time in @xmath255 and therefore linear

{"section_names": ["introduction", "definitions and previous work", "classical model", "ohbas on-line conjecture", "different list colouring models", "conclusions", "difference between choosability and paintability"], "sections": ["motivated by the processing of large social networks , we consider the study of graph colouring in an on - line streaming manner . as we know , storing and analyzing a large social graph in main memory for a single computer is not always possible . if the graph exceeds the capacity of the main memory , it has to be swapped to external memory . furthermore , in some cases , the social network graph to be processed may not be entirely known in advance . social networks rarely provide their complete graphs to third parties due to privacy issues . instead , they make their graphs accessible via api . if an external application aims to analyze the entire graph , it has to employ a local neighbourhood discovery protocol similar to web crawlers . in such a case , the application incurs costs associated with accessing a vertex of the graph in the form of the network communication necessary for issuing the api call . both of the aforementioned problems make the traditional off - line analysis of social network graphs challenging and sometimes even infeasible . thus , there is renewed interest in analysing graphs on - line .    aside from their practical application , on - line graph algorithms have also been a rich source of theoretical problems with , for example , the celebrated theoretical results of schauz  @xcite and zhu  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the graph list colouring problem in the on - line setting . in list colouring , the vertices of a graph are pre - assigned lists of colours , and the task is to properly colour the graph so that every vertex receives a colour from its list . in what follows , we study the problem from a theoretical point of view and resolve several open questions on this subject .", "the graphs considered in this paper are simple and undirected . we follow the standard terminology of graph theory ( cf .  for instance  @xcite ) . let @xmath0 be a graph . a _ list assignment _ is a function @xmath1 which assigns every vertex of @xmath0 a list of admissible colours . a proper colouring @xmath2 is called an _ @xmath3-colouring _ of @xmath0 if it assigns every vertex @xmath4 a colour @xmath5 from its list @xmath6 . the _ choosability number _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath7 , is the minimum number @xmath8 such that @xmath0 has an @xmath3-colouring whenever @xmath3 assigns every vertex a list of size at least @xmath8 . for any @xmath9 , graph @xmath0 is called _ @xmath8-choosable_. the choosability number of a graphs is sometimes also called the _ list - chromatic number_.    the ( off - line ) list colouring problem  to decide whether a graph has an @xmath3-colouring  was introduced by vizing in 1976  @xcite . the choosability of graphs was investigated by erds , rubin and taylor  @xcite and later by many others . if @xmath3 assigns every vertex the same list of colours , the instance of the list colouring problem becomes an instance of the `` standard '' vertex colouring problem . thus , @xmath10 and the problem is np - complete . voigt  @xcite showed in 1993 that the choosability number @xmath7 can be strictly larger than the chromatic number @xmath11 even for planar graphs . the list colouring problem was brought to the on - line setting independently by schauz  @xcite and zhu @xcite in 2009 . both the authors formulated the problem as a game of two players . in this paper , we follow the terminology of schauz  @xcite . the game is played by two players called mr .  paint and mrs . correct on a known graph @xmath0 . in each round , the first player , mr . paint , takes a new colour @xmath12 and colours some ( at least one ) uncoloured vertices . the colour @xmath12 can not be used again . there are no restrictions on the colouring of mr . paint  he can colour two adjacent vertices with the same colour . the other player , mrs . correct , attempts to correct mr . paint s mistakes . for this purpose , she has a finite number of so - called _ erasers _ assigned to every vertex . she can use an eraser to remove the colour @xmath12 from any subset of vertices which were coloured by mr . paint in this round . an eraser can be used only once . by doing so , the number of erasers available for the given vertex decreases . the game ends when the entire graph is properly coloured in which case mrs . correct wins , or when mrs . correct can not correct the colouring because she ran out of erasers for some vertex . in such a case , mr . paint wins . if @xmath3 is an assignment of erasers to the vertices of @xmath0 and mrs . correct has a winning strategy leading to a proper colouring of @xmath0 , the graph is called _ @xmath3-paintable_. if @xmath13 is a number of erasers that need to be assigned to every vertex of @xmath0 for mrs . correct to always have a winning strategy , the graph is called @xmath14-paintable . the minimum such number @xmath14 is the _ paintability number _ of a graph , and with respect to a graph @xmath0 , it is denoted by @xmath15 . note that if mr . paint writes down all the colours suggested for each vertex into a list and we should decide who has the winning strategy , we get an instance of off - line list colouring . both schauz @xcite and zhu  @xcite noted that if @xmath0 is not @xmath8-choosable , it can not be @xmath8-paintable . so , the choosability number provides a lower bound on the paintability number . we get that @xmath16 schauz  @xcite provided an example of a graph and an assignment of erasers @xmath3 where mr . paint has a winning strategy , i.e. , the graph is not @xmath3-paintable , however it has an ( off - line ) list colouring for any list assignment with lists of the respective sizes  ( see appendix  [ ap : winning - strategy ] ) . zhu  @xcite proved that the complete bipartite graphs @xmath17 for @xmath18 are not 3-paintable , however both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are 3-choosable . thus , there are graphs with choosability strictly smaller than paintability .    in 1994 , thomassen  @xcite showed that all planar graphs are 5-choosable . schauz  @xcite adapted this technique to the on - line list colouring model to show that every planar graph @xmath0 is 5-paintable . in the same paper , schauz also noted that _ `` @xmath21-paintability is stronger than the @xmath21-list - colourability ( @xmath21-choosability ) , but not by much . although [  ] there is a gap between these two notions , most theorems about list colourability hold for paintability as well . '' _    in  @xcite , ohba investigated the classes of graphs where the choosability number equals the chromatic number . he showed that if a graph is sufficiently dense , namely , if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 . as a strengthening of the result , he conjectured that if @xmath0 is a  graph with @xmath24 then @xmath23 . kim et al . @xcite studied ohba s conjecture for multipartite graphs in the on - line setting . they pointed out that , unlike the off - line case , graphs @xmath25 ( the complete multipartite graphs with @xmath26 parts of size 2 and one part of size 3 ) are not chromatic choosable on - line and thus adjusted the inequality :    [ con : ohba - online ] let @xmath0 be a graph with @xmath27 . then , @xmath28 .    a step towards proving conjecture  [ con : ohba - online ] was made by kozik , micek and zhu  @xcite , who showed that it holds for the graphs with independence number of at most  3 . furthermore , they proved  @xcite that the conjecture holds for graphs with @xmath29 .    additionally , there are various other results concerning the choosability and paintability of specific graph classes , see e.g.  @xcite .    * our contribution . * the main result of this paper is a proof of conjecture  [ con : ohba - online ] for the class of planar graphs ( section  [ sec : ohba ] ) . we also prove several results about paintability of classes of sparse graphs ( cf . section  [ sec : game - model ] ) . lastly we consider other possible models for the on - line list colouring problem ( section  [ sec : models ] ) .", "in this section , we focus on the `` classical '' game - theoretic model of list colouring introduced by schauz  @xcite . we investigate and extend results about paintability of graphs with small number of edges . in order to do so , we work with the recursive definition of the on - line list colouring problem : the game starts on graph @xmath0 with assignment of erasers @xmath21 . once the players finish a round , i.e. , mr . paint colours a set of vertices @xmath30 and mrs . correct erases the colours from some of them , denote her move by @xmath31 , the vertices in @xmath32 that remained coloured can be removed from the graph  those vertices are properly coloured and mr . paint will never use the same colour again . so , the game proceeds on a graph @xmath33 $ ] with one less eraser for the vertices in @xmath34 . see appendix  [ ap : game ] for formal definition . [ lem : good - degree ] let @xmath0 be a graph , @xmath4 a vertex of degree @xmath8 , and @xmath21 an assignment of erasers such that @xmath35 . if @xmath36 is @xmath21-paintable , then @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable . [ cor : apollonian ] ( a )  forests are @xmath39-paintable . ( b )  outer planar graphs are @xmath40-paintable . ( c )  series - parallel graphs are @xmath40-paintable .

( f )  planar graphs are @xmath42-paintable by inductive argument in  @xcite . by degeneracy , they are trivially @xmath43-paintable .    _ series - parallel _ graphs are graphs with two distinguished vertices @xmath44 and @xmath45 called _ source _ and _ sink_. the class itself is defined inductively as follows : ( 1 ) an edge @xmath46 is a series - parallel graph ; and ( 2 ) any graph @xmath0 that can be obtained from two series - parallel graphs by a series or parallel composition on theirs sources and sinks is a series - parallel graph .    it is easy to see that the class of series parallel graphs is a subclass of planar graphs and thus , they are @xmath42-paintable . it is well - known that series - parallel graphs are 2-degenerate , so they are even @xmath40-paintable . we wish to offer an alternate _ inductive _ argument which implies this statement . the significance of this result is given by the following : while most of the techniques for list colouring off - line can be transferred to the on - line setting , it is _ not always possible _ for inductive arguments . inspired by thomassen s proof of 5-choosability of planar graphs  @xcite , and also by the proof of their 5-paintability by schauz  @xcite , we prove a slightly stronger claim ( the proof is provided in appendix  [ ap : game ] ) :    [ thm : sp ] let @xmath47 be a series - parallel graph with source  @xmath44 and sink  @xmath45 , and @xmath21 an assignment of erasers such that @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 for any other vertex . graph @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable . a.   @xmath144 is @xmath21-paintable ( since @xmath145 , @xmath21 is an empty tuple ) . b.   @xmath146 is @xmath21-paintable if @xmath147 for every @xmath148 , and every non - empty subset @xmath149 of vertices contains a _ good _ subset @xmath31 such that @xmath150 $ ] is @xmath151-paintable where @xmath152 for @xmath153 and @xmath154 otherwise . let @xmath37 be arbitrary , but fixed . proceed by induction on the number of vertices @xmath128 . if @xmath155 , the graph has one isolated vertex and thus , it is @xmath38-paintable . let @xmath0 be a @xmath8-degenerate graph with @xmath156 . by definition , it has vertex @xmath4 of degree at most @xmath8 such that @xmath36 is also a @xmath8-degenerate graph . so , by induction , @xmath52 is @xmath38-paintable and @xmath0 is @xmath38-paintable by lemma  [ lem : good - degree ] .    by induction on the number , we prove the following claim : graph @xmath157 ( if edge @xmath46 does not exist , @xmath158 ) with @xmath159 is @xmath151-paintable for @xmath160 and @xmath161 for any other vertex @xmath4 . note that the claim immediately implies @xmath21-paintability of @xmath0 if it does not contain edge @xmath46 . if edge @xmath46 is present , mrs . correct can follow the same strategy as in @xmath162 , but use the one eraser assigned to @xmath45 by @xmath21 in order to ensure different colours of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . thus , @xmath21-paintability of @xmath0 is guaranteed in this case as well . so , let @xmath0 be a series parallel graph with @xmath164 vertices . by definition , @xmath0 is obtained from two series - parallel graphs , call them @xmath165 with sources @xmath166 and sinks @xmath167 respectively . we proceed in two cases :    _ case 1 : @xmath0 is obtained by parallel composition . _ by definition of the parallel composition @xmath168 and @xmath169 . paint s move be set of vertices @xmath30 . by the recursive definition of paintability , the task of mrs . correct is to find a good subset @xmath34 where erasers will be used such that @xmath150 $ ] is paintable for the respective assignment of erasers ( the number of erasers for vertices in @xmath79 decreases ) . by induction , this is possible for both graphs @xmath170 with assignment of erasers @xmath151 , and mr . paint s moves @xmath171 and @xmath172 . denote the good subsets played by mrs . correct @xmath173 and @xmath174 respectively . note that mrs . correct can not include @xmath44 and @xmath45 in her good subset in any of the graphs as they do not have any erasers . thus , set @xmath175 is good for @xmath176 and it is @xmath151-paintable . if @xmath0 does not contain edge @xmath46 , it is @xmath21-paintable immediately , otherwise the aforementioned argument applies .    _ case 2 : @xmath0 is obtained by series composition . _ note that in this case , @xmath0 does not contain edge @xmath46 , so @xmath177 . furthermore , @xmath178 is assigned 2 erasers by @xmath21 . again , we show that mrs . correct can find a good subset @xmath34 in any move @xmath30 of mr .  paint . by induction , @xmath179 and @xmath180 are both @xmath151-paintable . analogously as in the previous case , mrs . correct will play the union of her winning strategy moves for the smaller graphs . when playing on @xmath0 with eraser assignment @xmath21 , whenever some of @xmath181 appear in mr . paint s move , mrs . correct can use one of the two erasers assigned to @xmath182 , possibly in combination with the eraser of @xmath183 , in order to guarantee that those three vertices are painted differently in case edges @xmath184 and @xmath185 are present . we proceed by induction on @xmath8 . if @xmath186 , the vertex is isolated . hence , it can stay coloured whenever it is included in mr . paint s move . so , assume that @xmath187 . let @xmath52 be @xmath21-paintable graph . consider the options how mr . paint can colour @xmath4 . if mr . paint colours set @xmath188 which includes @xmath4 but does not include any of its neighbours , mrs . correct can leave @xmath4 coloured and does not need an eraser . if @xmath53 includes some vertices of @xmath4 and mrs . correct uses eraser for all of them , then @xmath4 can be left coloured and mrs . correct does not need to use an eraser either . so , an eraser is needed if and only if @xmath53 includes some neighbours of @xmath4 and mrs . correct s move @xmath79 does not use an eraser for at least one of them . in the resulting state of game , @xmath4 has degree at most @xmath26 and at least @xmath26 erasers , so the statement holds by induction . \\(a ) if mrs . correct has a winning strategy on @xmath0 , she can pursue the same strategy on @xmath51 ignoring the removed vertices and edges . as removing a structure from @xmath0 can not invalidate any intermediate colouring created during the game , the strategy is winning on @xmath51 . \\(b ) one implication holds by  ( a ) : if @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable , @xmath52 is its subgraph , so it is @xmath21-paintable too . conversely , if @xmath52 is @xmath21-paintable , we consider what options of moves mr .  paint has with respect to @xmath4 . if @xmath4 is included in mr . paint s set which contains no neighbour of @xmath4 , mrs . correct can leave @xmath4 coloured and does not need an eraser . if some neighbours of @xmath4 are included in mr . paint s move and mrs . correct uses an eraser for all of them , then @xmath4 can be left coloured without using an eraser . so , erasers for @xmath4 are needed only when a neighbour @xmath189 of @xmath4 belongs to mr . paint s move together with @xmath4 and mrs . correct does not use an eraser for @xmath189 . however , this happens at most @xmath8-times .", "in this section , we prove the on - line version of the ohba s conjecture ( cf .  conjecture  [ con : ohba - online ] ) for planar graphs ( see theorem  [ thm : ohba ] ) . our approach utilizes the following proposition which appears in  @xcite ( see also appendix  [ ap : game ] ) :      a.   if @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable , every subgraph @xmath51 of @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable . b.   if @xmath21 assigns every vertex @xmath4 of degree @xmath8 at least @xmath8 erasers , @xmath0 is @xmath21-paintable if and only if @xmath52 is @xmath21-paintable .

respective moves of mrs . denote the graph obtained by playing the moves by @xmath51 . observe that the graph obtained by playing moves @xmath59 and @xmath60 by mr . paint and mrs . correct is equal

@xmath64 , and replace the move @xmath61 with two subsequent moves @xmath55 ( in this order ) . assume that mrs . correct has a winning strategy by moves @xmath65 after this modification . by the observation above , mrs . correct s response @xmath60 is a winning response to mr . paint s move @xmath61 . this is a contradiction . repeat this argument to produce a winning strategy of mr . paint such that he always colours a connected induced subgraph of @xmath0 . let @xmath0 be a connected planar graph with @xmath66 . recall that if @xmath0 has independence number of at most @xmath40 , the statment holds  @xcite . by the four colour theorem , @xmath67 , so we proceed in four cases based on @xmath11 . * case 2 : @xmath70 . * if the chromatic number is @xmath39 , the graph is bipartite . one should consider planar graphs of size up to @xmath41 vertices . in fact , using proposition  [ prop : carraher ] , it is sufficient to prove the claim for the complete bipartite graphs on @xmath41 vertices . there are two is not connected , so it is both @xmath69-chromatic and @xmath69-paintable . ] possible distributions of vertices into the two partitions , so there are precisely two such graphs : @xmath71 and @xmath72 . graph @xmath71 is a tree , so it is @xmath39-paintable ( cf . corollary  [ cor : apollonian ] ) .    for @xmath73 , we consider three cases of mr . paint s first move . if he colours one vertex only , no erasers are used up and the game continues on a tree . so , mrs . correct has winning strategy . paint colours more than two vertices , two of them , without loss of generality @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are not adjacent to each other . mrs . correct leaves @xmath74 and @xmath75 coloured and uses erasers for the rest . then the game continues on a graph with two isolated vertices where no erasers are needed . so , the only option of mr . paint is to initially colour two adjacent vertices , say @xmath74 and @xmath76 . correct uses eraser for one of them , say @xmath76 . the game continues on a path @xmath77 where @xmath76 has no erasers , and the remaining vertices have each one eraser available . one can easily see that mrs . correct wins the game here too . * case 3 : @xmath78 . * applying proposition  [ prop : carraher ] , it is sufficient to show that graphs with 6 vertices and chromatic number @xmath40 need to be considered . graphs with no odd cycle are bipartite , thus @xmath39-chromatic . we divide the case into two subcases : when @xmath0 contains a cycle of length @xmath40 and @xmath42 .    if @xmath0 contains a cycle of length @xmath42 , any independent set contains at most two vertices of this cycle . together with the last vertex , the independece number of @xmath0 is at most @xmath40 and thus , the claim holds .    if @xmath0 contains a cycle @xmath79 of length @xmath40 , any independent set contains at most one vertex of this cycle . as @xmath80 , the independence number is at most @xmath41 , in which case the vertices not in @xmath79 , call them @xmath81 , must be part of the independet set . assume that this is the case ( otherwise the claim again holds ) . observe that @xmath81 are connected to at most two vertices of @xmath79 otherwise they can not be all members of the independent set . hence , their degrees are at most two , and @xmath0 is @xmath39-degenerate . hence , @xmath0 is @xmath40-paintable by theorem  [ thm : degeneracy ] . * case 4 : @xmath82 . * as @xmath11 can not be more than @xmath41 , if one can prove the claim for triangulated graphs on @xmath83 vertices , it holds for all the 4-chromatic planar graphs on 8 vertices by proposition  [ prop : carraher ] . let @xmath4 be a vertex in @xmath0 . as @xmath0 is triangulated , the neighbours @xmath84 of @xmath4 form a cycle @xmath79 . the subgraph @xmath79 togehter with @xmath4 and its attachments to the vertices in @xmath79 is called a _ wheel_. vertex @xmath4 is called a _ hub _ of this wheel and @xmath79 is its _ rim_. in order to show that the independence number of @xmath0 is at most @xmath40 , we analyse @xmath0 based on its wheels .    observe that @xmath0 , being a planar triangulation on @xmath83 vertices , contains precisely @xmath85 triangular faces and @xmath86 edges . the maximum size of an independent set is at most @xmath41 as every triangular face can contribute at most one vertex . a wheel of size @xmath8 contains @xmath87 edges . furthermore , the maximum independence number of such a wheel is @xmath88 and it can not include the hub ( the only independent set which includes the hub has size @xmath69 as it can not include any other vertex ) . the sum of vertex degrees in @xmath0 is @xmath89 . hence , @xmath0 must contain a vertex of degree at least @xmath42 . if @xmath0 contains a vertex of degree @xmath42 , the wheel around this vertex has size @xmath43 , the rim is a @xmath42-cycle and the wheel has @xmath90 edges . also , @xmath0 has two vertices @xmath91 that do not belong to this wheel . in order to obtain an independent set of size @xmath41 , both @xmath92 and @xmath4 have to be added into an independent set @xmath93 of size @xmath39 found in the wheel . to fill the remaining @xmath83 edges into @xmath0 , at least one of @xmath91 must have degree at least @xmath41 . thus , it has to be attached to one of the vertices that are already in @xmath93 . hence , the independence number of @xmath0 is at most  @xmath40 . if @xmath0 contains a vertex @xmath4 of degree @xmath43 , in order to construct an independent set of size @xmath41 , one has to find an independent set @xmath93 of size @xmath40 in the wheel around @xmath4 and fill in the additional vertex @xmath92 that is not part of the wheel . refer to fig . [ fig : ap - triangulation ] . without loss of generality , on can select vertices @xmath94 into @xmath93 . as @xmath92 needs to belong to @xmath93 as well , it can not be connected to neither of @xmath94 . as @xmath0 is triangulated , it must contain edges @xmath95 that enclose the wheels around @xmath94 respectively . then @xmath92 must be connected to @xmath96 . such a graph is an apollonian network : starting with triangle @xmath96 , one subdivides its inner face by @xmath4 obtaining an embedded graph isomorphic to @xmath97 , and then subdivides all of its triangular faces by vertices @xmath98 . by corollary  [ cor : apollonian ] , such a graph is @xmath41-paintable .    if @xmath0 contains a vertex of degree @xmath99 , all the vertices in the graph form a wheel of size @xmath83 around this vertex . hence , the maximum independent set has size @xmath40 . so , in all subcases of case 4 , graph @xmath0 has independence at most @xmath40 and the claim holds , or it is the graph depicted in fig .  [ fig : ap - triangulation ] , which is @xmath41-paintable by degeneracy .", "one of the initially suggested motivations for investigating the list colouring problem on - line was analysing big graphs on a single server with limited memory . a large disadvantage of the game model of mr .  paint and mrs . correct is that it does not contribute to lowering the memory requirements . in this section , we suggest and investigate alternate models for the list colouring problem . one could hope in eliminating the former requirement by giving a smart strategy for mrs . correct which will be `` good enough '' and yet will not require mrs . correct to know the entire graph . unfortunately , there is no hope in overcoming the latter obstacle . if a large number of vertices in the graph ( possibly all of them ) share a single colour in their lists , they may have to be all processed ( i.e. , loaded into the memory ) within a single round of the game at some point . moreover , there may be multiple colours shared among many vertices , so there may be multiple memory - expensive rounds within the game . an alternative to the `` classical '' game model for list colouring is what we call the _ true on - line list colouring model_. in this model , the adversary reveals vertices of a graph @xmath0 in a sequence @xmath100 where every vertex @xmath101 is revealed with a list of admissible colours @xmath102 and edges @xmath103 where @xmath104 . the on - line algorithm @xmath105 has to assign a colour @xmath106 to every vertex @xmath101 immediately when the vertex appears . additionally , it can re - assign a colour for any other vertex @xmath107 . at any given moment , the colouring of the graph maintained by @xmath105 must be proper , i.e. , no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same colour . assigning a colour to a vertex ( both the initial assignment and re - colouring ) has an associated cost @xmath69 . the _ cost _ of @xmath105 on sequence @xmath108 , denoted by @xmath109 is the total number of colour assignments that @xmath105 performs in order to colour the graph . if @xmath0 does not have an @xmath3-colouring , we set the cost @xmath110 . the notion of cost in the true on - line list colouring model naturally captures the cost of executing an on - line algorithm : whenever a vertex needs to be coloured or re - coloured , it has to be loaded into memory . optimally , every vertex appears in the memory exactly once , i.e. , the algorithm will require no re - colourings . the following theorem shows that even though this model exhibits potential to reduce the memory traffic , it is not always the case . consider two disjoint paths @xmath56 and @xmath57 on @xmath111 vertices where each vertex @xmath112 is assigned a list @xmath113 . let @xmath105 be the best deterministic on - line algorithm and let the colour assigned to vertex @xmath4 by @xmath105 be denoted by @xmath114 . a cruel adversary proceeds as follows . if @xmath56 and @xmath57 have two ends , call them @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively , such that @xmath117 , the adversary reveals a vertex @xmath118 with list @xmath119 attached to @xmath115 and @xmath116 . let the resulting path be denoted by @xmath53 . at this point , one of @xmath56 , @xmath57 has to be re - coloured , and the algorithm incurs cost @xmath120 . if there are no two ends with distinct colours , the adversary first reveals a vertex @xmath121 attached to one end of @xmath56 with list @xmath119 and then proceeds as in the previous case in order to join @xmath56 to @xmath57 ( see fig . [ fig : construction ] ) . if the adversary constructed @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the same fashion ( inductively starting from isolated vertices ) , the on - line algorithm pays total cost @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 denote the sequences of revealing @xmath125 and @xmath57 respectively and @xmath126 is a constant dependent of the way of connecting @xmath56 and @xmath57 . applying the master theorem  @xcite , we obtain that @xmath127          at the beginning of the game , mrs . correct chooses @xmath74 to be coloured by mr . paint in the first round . so , mr . paint chooses set @xmath56 which includes @xmath74 and perhaps some additional vertices . note that by lemma  [ lem : connected ] , we can assume that @xmath130 $ ] is connected . correct leaves @xmath74 coloured , and uses an eraser for vertices in @xmath56 whose distance from @xmath74 is odd . when the coloured vertices are removed , @xmath0 falls apart into a forest of trees that can be rooted so that every non - leaf node has at least one eraser available ( see fig .  [ fig : strong](b ) ) . it is easy to see that on such a graph , mrs . correct wins under the `` classical '' game model , and thus also under the strong game model .", "we considered the on - line graph list colouring problem under several models . we extended the previous results about paintability of planar graphs to some specific graph classes . we provided an inductive argument for @xmath40-paintability of series - parallel graphs . for future work , we would like to suggest extending the following two theorems to the on - line setting :          our strong game model stands somewhere in between off - line list colouring and the `` classical '' on - line model . we showed that the model differs from the `` classical '' game model , but we do not believe that it is equivalent to the list colouring problem off - line . it is known that traditional paintability is stronger than choosability . however , no example of a graph @xmath0 where @xmath131 is known ( see e.q . * question 4 ) ) . therefore , in our opinion , strong game paintability together with its relation to paintability and off - line choosability is very intriguing and worth further investigation .", "the fact the list colouring on - line differs from list colouring off - line can be justified for instance on the graph depicted in fig .

( b ) @xmath21 as a function of the moving velocity @xmath1 for sweep length @xmath49m.,width=275 ]    the distinctive difference of the impenetrable case from the penetrable case is that there is a density - depleted region occupied by the obstacle . hence , it is possible for vortices to be emitted individually into the condensate . the individually emitted vortices would disturb the superfluid velocity field around the obstacle more strongly than a vortex dipole , leading to irregular vortex shedding or possibly more intriguing shedding patterns such as the bnard - von krmn vortex street  @xcite .    in fig . 5 , we present several vortex images containing a few vortex dipoles . it is clearly seen that the vortex shedding pattern is irregular in the impenetrable case and was often observed that the propagation direction of the first vortex dipole largely deviated from the moving direction of the obstacle [ fig . 5(a ) ] , implying that the two vortices were emitted at different times from the obstacle . furthermore , vortex clusters having larger density - depleted cores were sometimes observed [ fig . 5(c ) ]  @xcite . on the other hand , the first vortex dipole from a penetrable obstacle usually propagates along the moving direction of the obstacle . symmetric periodic array of vortex dipoles are known to be unstable towards staggered configurations of vortex dipoles  @xcite , which were typically observed in the experiment when multiple vortex dipoles were generated  [ figs . 5(d ) and ( e ) ] . occasionally , symmetric trains of vortex dipoles were observed  [ fig . 5(f ) ] .     moving direction of the obstacle . the dashed lines indicate the moving line of the obstacle . ( c ) vortex clusters having larger density - depleted regions were also observed . in the penetrable case , staggered configurations of multiple vortex dipoles were typically observed . ( f ) occasionally , symmetric trains of vortex dipoles also appeared.,width=257 ]", "in the experiment data for the penetrable obstacle in fig . 2(a ) , it is evident that fluctuations of the vortex dipole number @xmath21 are strongly suppressed for @xmath50 and even vanish for some conditions . this is an outstanding feature of the periodic vortex shedding , suggesting that deterministic generation of a single vortex dipole is possible when applying a short sweep of the penetrable laser beam . in this section , we characterize this short sweep method by examining the stability of the propagation velocity of the generated vortex dipole .    in figs . 6(a ) and ( b ) , we show two exemplary images for @xmath51  mm / s with @xmath52  ms and 7.5  ms , respectively . in the first image , a vortex dipole is located near the center region and clearly identified with its two distinctive density - depleted cores . on the other hand , in the second image that is taken with a short sweeping time @xmath53 , a small crescent - shaped density dimple is observed with low visibility in the boundary region of the condensate . we interpret this density dimple as an incipient vortex dipole with a short intervortex distance @xmath54 , which can not be fully developed because of the short sweeping time . the incipient vortex dipole moves further away from the sweeping region because of higher propagation speed @xmath55 for smaller @xmath54 and its low visibility might be attributed to the blurring effect during the expansion before imaging . and the sweeping times were ( a ) @xmath52  ms and ( b ) 7.5  ms at @xmath51  mm / s , respectively . for long @xmath22 , the vortex dipole is clearly identified with its two vortex cores near the center region . for short @xmath22 , it appears as a small density dimple with low visibility in the boundary region . the enlarged images of the vortex dipoles are presented on the right side of each image . ( c ) vortex distribution in the plane of radial position and visibility , obtained from all the images containing a single vortex dipole in the experiment for @xmath51  mm / s [ fig . 2(a)].,width=264 ]    compiling all the images containing a single vortex dipole for @xmath51  mm / s , in fig . 6(c ) we display the distribution of the vortex dipoles in the plane of radial position and visibility . the visibility was determined as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the density minimum value in the core region and @xmath58 is the average density in the surrounding area of the vortex dipole . the distribution shows a strong correlation between the visibility of the vortex dipole and its radial position , i.e. , propagation speed , revealing the temporal development of the vortex dipole . from a rough estimation , taking into account the expansion time in the imaging sequence , we find that the propagation speed of the most incipient vortex dipole is comparable to the moving velocity of the obstacle , which is expected from the fact that the vortex dipole is shed from the moving obstacle . the condition of @xmath59 gives the intervortex distance @xmath60 . when the sweeping time is not sufficiently long , although long enough to ensure generation of a vortex dipole , the speed of the generated vortex dipole is not reproducible . for example , when @xmath61 or 10  ms , the vortex generation probability is almost unity but the vortex dipole velocity widely scatters [ open circles in fig .  6(c ) ] . this is partially due to the uncertainty of the vortex emission time and also probably due to the finite dwelling time of the vortex dipole in the proximity of the laser beam , which might be estimated to be @xmath62 . therefore , for deterministic generation of a single vortex dipole , the sweeping time needs to be optimally chosen to have better stability in the vortex dipole velocity @xmath63 . we examined the stability of @xmath63 by putting an additional 100  ms hold time before releasing the trapping potential and measuring the change in the vortex position . in our experiment , the propagation speed of the vortex dipole was stable within 10% and its propagation direction was parallel within 15 degrees to the sweeping direction of the laser beam . it needs to be mentioned that we can not exclude the possibility that the crescent - shaped density dimple is a rarefaction pulse or a gray soliton , which can also propagate with preserving its density profile with a nonzero density minimum  @xcite . when the energy accumulated by the moving obstacle is not sufficient to generate a vortex dipole , it can possibly transform into lower energy excitation . the sudden stop of the moving obstacle might play a role in forming and stabilizing the excitation .     on various sweeping parameters of the penetrable obstacle .

{"section_names": ["introduction", "observation", "genus statistic", "results", "discussion and conclusions", "acknowledgements"], "sections": ["the origin and the evolution of the large scale structures attract much attention and the understanding about the statistical nature of the mass distributions in the universe is one of the important issues to be addressed in the observational cosmology . the inflationary theory gives us a definite prediction on the statistical properties , namely the random gaussian nature of the initial density fluctuation . the density fluctuation evolves by gravitational instability to have the non - linear distribution , i.e. non - gaussianity , at later stage whose details may depend on the cosmological parameters as well as the nature of dark matter . thus the measurement of statistical properties of the density distribution is very important for the understanding of the formation and evolution of large scale structures . the topology of large scale structures was qualitatively described by @xcite and its quantitative study was initiated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and has been studied by many authors on the basis of various observational data . for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite investigated the genus or the euler - poincae characteristic statistics of the topology in two - dimensional fields of galaxy distribution . further , the method has been applied for various kinds of observational samples , the angular distributions of galaxies on the sky @xcite , the galaxy distributions in slices of the universe @xcite and the temperature fluctuation fields of the cosmic microwave background @xcite . recently the topology of the galaxy distributions in 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey and sloan digital sky survey has been studied by @xcite and @xcite . these studies show that the topology of the two - dimensional galaxy distribution is consistent with the random phase gaussian distribution with a possible weak meat - ball topology where the topology is called meat - ball when it looks like collection of isolated islands . more recently , @xcite calculated the two - dimensional genus statistics for the contour maps of the galaxy distribution in the hubble deep field . using the red - shift distribution of galaxies measured by the method of photometric red - shift , they studied the evolution effect in the topology however , the genus curves was consistent with random gaussian field , and they were not able to discover any meaningful red - shift dependence . previous topological studies using galaxy distributions suffer from the biasing effect between visible galaxies and underlying mass distributions and it is not clear whether the galaxy distribution traces mass distribution in the universe precisely . thus it would be very useful to develop a method to measure mass distributions in the universe directly . we shall make use of weak gravitational lensing techniques for this purpose . weak lensing directly measures the projected mass distributions from the observed image distortions of background galaxies and thus can be used to compare the observational results directly with the theoretical and/or numerical predictions . the reliability of the weak lensing techniques for measuring the mass distributions on large scales has been widely recognized , for example , by cosmic shear measurements @xcite . our method for addressing this problem makes use of the genus curves for weak lensing maps of the convergence field . @xcite have studied quantitatively the method based on two dimensional minkowski functionals ( the genus curve is one of the minkowski functionals ) via @xmath1-body and ray - tracing simulations , and demonstrated its feasibility in the determination of the cosmological density parameter , @xmath2 . using the two dimensional genus statistic , @xcite also studied the topology of weak lensing fields , and found that the genus curve for large smoothing angles agrees with the predictions from linear theory , while that for smoothing angles smaller than @xmath3 shows the non - gaussian signatures of gravitational clustering and differs for open and flat cold dark matter models .    in the present paper , we report the first measurement of genus curves for the two - dimensional mass map in the neighborhood of distant rich galaxy cluster ms1054 - 03 , reconstructed from weak lensing data obtained by suprime - cam ( subaru prime focus camera ) on @xmath4 m subaru telescope @xcite . we examine the non - gaussian feature in the measured genus curve by comparing it with a gaussian prediction , and demonstrate the feasibility of the method to examine the statistical properties of the large scale mass distributions in the universe .", "we observed the rich , x - ray - luminous galaxy cluster ms1054 - 03 at @xmath0 on the night of 2001 march 29 using suprime - cam mounted at the prime focus of @xmath4 m subaru telescope @xcite . we obtained a mosaic of @xmath5-band images with a total exposure time of @xmath6 ksec , which covers the sky area of @xmath7 arcmin@xmath8 with the seeing fwhm of @xmath9 . for weak lensing analysis , we selected galaxies of @xmath10 with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) greater than @xmath11 in the central @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 region . the number of objects in the weak - lensing catalog is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 arcmin@xmath13 ) . we have reconstructed the projected mass distribution from the image distortions of sample galaxies via kaiser & squires method @xcite in fourier space . we first calculated the gaussian smoothed shear field with @xmath16 from the weak lensing catalog , where the gaussian window is defined by @xmath17 . the shear map is then 100% zero - padded on each side to avoid spurious effects from periodic boundary condition . in figure [ fig_1 ] , we show the reconstructed convergence map with a side length of @xmath18 and pixel size of @xmath19 . the reconstructed convergence map shows a significant mass peak with s / n of @xmath20 associated with the rich cluster ms1054 - 03 .", "the genus statistic provides a topological description of large scale structures in the universe . since the weak lensing field is mapped on the sky , the two dimensional genus statistic is used in this case . for the local convergence field @xmath21 shown in figure [ fig_1 ] , we consider contour lines of a threshold value labelled by @xmath22 . the threshold @xmath22 is usually taken as @xmath23 for random gaussian field , where @xmath24 is the rms of the field , @xmath25 . the genus curve is expressed as function of this threshold level @xmath22 . the two dimensional genus @xmath26 is intuitively defined as @xcite , @xmath27    for a random gaussian field , the genus curve is analytically given by @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 . let us consider the meaning of value of the genus . if the value of genus is positive , then there is more isolated clusters than isolated voids and thus we can get an image that the topology is collection of isolated islands . so , when the value of genus takes large positive value , the topology is compared to meat - ball. on the other hand , if the value of genus is negative , there is less isolated clusters than isolated voids . in this case the topology gives an image of the complicated shape with a lot of holes , and the topology is compared to swiss cheese. thus we say the genus curve shows a meat - ball shift and swiss cheese shift when the curve deviates from gaussian shape to positive direction and to negative direction , respectively . gaussian expression of equation [ eq_2 ] is not expected for the present weak lensing data because the survey area is not large enough to probe the linear scales . however , it is known that the shape of the genus curve of mass distribution fields is not strongly affected by nonlinear gravitational evolution as shown by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . thus we use the method of rescaled labeling of @xmath22 . for non - gaussian fields , the threshold is defined through the fraction of area @xmath31 on the high - density side of the contour lines , which is related to the corresponding value of @xmath22 for a gaussian field as , @xmath32 for a gaussian field , this definition gives the same result as specifying the threshold directly in units of @xmath24 . on the other hand , for a non - gaussian field , it compensates for the horizontal shift of the genus curve due to the shift of distribution function of the density field . we adopt this prescription for setting the threshold values of @xmath21 in the results shown below .    to calculate the genus curves for the convergence map given as pixel data , we employed the method developed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . we confirmed that this code gives the same result as from contour2d developed by @xcite . at each threshold level @xmath22 , the genus is obtained as an average over three genus values with @xmath22s shifted by 0 and @xmath330.1 as done in @xcite .", "figure [ fig_2 ] shows the genus curve measured from the convergence field shown in figure [ fig_1 ] . the gaussian prediction curve is also calculated by equation [ eq_2 ] , with the normalization factor obtained from the least-@xmath34 fitting to the measured genus curve . the errors for the genus measurements are estimated from @xmath35-bootstrap resamplings of the background galaxies . we evaluated the curvature only at interior vertices for genus calculation . figure [ fig_2 ] shows a clear difference between the random gaussian prediction curve and the curve measured from the observational data . furthermore , we found that compared with the random gaussian prediction , the observed curve was shifted upwards near the threshold of @xmath36 . this indicates that the number of isolated clusters dominates over number of isolated voids , which is the so called meat - ball shift. this phenomenon is usually seen when the field evolves into non - gaussian from gaussian . however , it is difficult to judge from this result shown in figure [ fig_2 ] whether this non - gaussianity for the genus curve is influenced by the rich cluster contained in this region or by the large scale structures .    to clarify the origin of the non - gaussian nature , we divided the reconstructed convergence map into four square regions with the same size , and calculated the genus curve for each sub - region . as indicated in figure [ fig_3 ] , we call each sub - region as region 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . the rich cluster ms1054 - 03 is contained in region 3 .    figure [ fig_3 ] shows the genus curves for the sub - regions and their best - fit gaussian genus curves , obtained in the same way as for the whole field . from figure [ fig_3 ] , we see that the genus curve for the region 3 has a large skew and a meat - ball shift. on the other hand , the genus curves for the regions 2 and 4 are consistent with random gaussian curves . the genus curve for the region 1 shows a slight excess in the high threshold region . our weak lensing analysis shows a significant mass concentration associated with the rich cluster , therefore the highly non - gaussian feature in the genus curve could be induced by this rich cluster in the region 3 . the skewness is also a powerful statistical tool to measure the deviation from a random gaussian distribution , defined by @xmath37 . we summarized in table [ tab_1 ] the skewness measured for each sub - region . we see the skewness for the region 3 is quite larger than that for any other region .", "we have measured for the first time the genus curves of the convergence map reconstructed from image distortions of faint background galaxies , as the first step for addressing the statistical properties of the mass distributions on large scales . the genus curve measured in the whole survey field ( figure [ fig_1 ] ) shows a deviation from the random gaussian prediction , i.e. non - gaussianity of the field . by dividing the whole map into four independent regions and analyzing them separately , we showed that the non - gaussianity is induced by the rich cluster contained in the survey region ( region 3 ) . on the other hand , as for the regions without the rich cluster , we also found a slight excess of the genus amplitude in the high - thresholds for region 1 , whereas the genus curves for regions 2 and 4 are consistent with random gaussian distributions . we thus averaged the genus curves of the regions 1 , 2 , and 4 by inverse variance weighting at each threshold bin . the resulting genus curve shown in figure [ fig_4 ] is consistent with the random gaussian one at each threshold bin within @xmath38 error . we thus conclude the excess of the genus curve in region 1 is not due to the non - gaussianity but is caused by the sample variance due to the small area of the region as discussed by @xcite . our results might be influenced by the choice of smoothing angle ( @xmath39 in the paper ) . the effective number of galaxies used for the local shear average decreases as smoothing angle decreases , and then the reconstructed convergence map is much influenced by the random noise due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxy ellipticities . thus the genus curves approach to the random gaussian predictions as smoothing angles become smaller . @xcite discussed the effects of the smoothing angle on the genus measurements by the simulations with survey area of about @xmath40 degree@xmath8 . they concluded that for the smoothing angle of @xmath41 , the genus curve shows a non - gaussian meat - ball shift. on smoothing angles smaller than @xmath42 , it is not clear yet whether the observed non - gaussianity is real or not . we have not used @xmath41 because it could decrease the number of independent samplings , and thus affect our analysis .    in order to clearly see the deviation due to large scale structure , we definitely need to observe much wider region which will be planned in the near future survey by suprime - cam on subaru telescope . the present study demonstrates the feasibility of the genus statistic for the weak lensing mass maps to examine directly the statistical properties of the large scale mass distributions in the universe .", "we are very grateful to masahiro takada and chan -

grain description ) presented in refs .   and can be obtained by taking a `` partial '' average on the stochastic master equation over the fine grained measurement records of the tunneling events in the set . finally , we present some monte carlo simulation results for the scb / set measurement process . we also analyze an important ensemble quantity for an initial qubit state readout experiment , @xmath0 the probability distribution @xcite of finding @xmath1 electrons that have tunneled into the drain of the set in time @xmath2 . this analysis demonstrates further the connection between the quantum trajectory approach presented here and the `` partially '' reduced density matrix approach in refs .   and .", "the hamiltonian of the scb / set system is described in refs .   and as : @xmath4 briefly , @xmath5 describes the charging energy of the set . the charge on the middle island is @xmath6 , and the induced charge @xmath7 is determined by the gate voltage @xmath8 and other voltages in the circuit . @xmath9 where @xmath10 , describes microscopic degrees of freedom of noninteracting electrons in the two leads ( left and right ) and the middle island of the set , respectively . to make the charge transfer explicit , two `` macroscopic '' operators , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are included in the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite in the set : @xmath13 the effective hamiltonian of the uncoupled qubit , written in the charge eigen basis of the number @xmath14 of extra cooper pair on the island of scb , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 with eigenvalues @xmath17 or @xmath18 . the capacitive coulomb coupling between the charge on the set island and that on the scb qubit is represented by @xmath19    we will consider the case that the leading tunneling process in the set are sequential transitions between two adjacent charge states @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( say , @xmath22 and @xmath23 states to represent the extra charge on the set island ) . this would be the case if the applied transport voltage across the set is not too high and the temperature is low ( for simplicity , we consider the zero temperature case ) . since , effectively , only two adjacent charge states @xmath22 and @xmath23 are considered , the charge transfer operators @xmath24 , in this case , satisfy @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the other set of charge transfer operators satisfy @xmath28 , where @xmath1 represents the number of electrons that has tunneled into the right lead ( drain ) of the set .", "to be able to describe the measured qubit in a pure state continuously , one needs to have the maximum knowledge about the change of its state . when the qubit interacts with ( is measured by ) the set , this information is lost to the set . for example , each time when an electron tunnels onto or off the set island , it will cause a change ( e.g. , a phase shift ) of the qubit state . one can recover this information lost , provided that a detailed measurement record from the set is available . the transport of electrons through the set occurs via real states of the central island , from @xmath29 . the information of detecting the @xmath30 electron just tunneling into the drain only tells us that the island state now is in @xmath31 state . thus knowing the `` partially '' reduced density matrix @xmath32 at every time @xcite does not provide us with the full information . one can imagine that in the transport process , electrons may spend different times in the intermediate @xmath33 state , causing different phase shifts to the qubit . if the record of the times when electrons tunneling onto and off the island is not available from the measurement results of the set , our knowledge about the precise qubit state decreases . when this happens , averaging the random dwelling times of electrons on the island over a period of time or over an ensemble of systems will then lead to the decoherence of the qubit . hence , one needs to have a measurement record which records whether or not an electron tunnels onto or off the central island of the set at each time interval @xmath34 . this time interval @xmath34 should be much smaller than the typical qubit system evolution or response time so that no information is lost as far as the qubit system evolution is concerned . in this sense , effectively the qubit is continuously monitored or measured .    for this purpose , we introduce @xmath35 and @xmath36 to represent , in the _ quantum - jump _ case @xcite , the number ( either zero or one ) of tunneling events seen in infinitesimal time @xmath34 through the left and right junctions of the set , respectively . throughout the paper , the subscript or superscript @xmath37 indicates that the quantity to which it is attached is conditioned on previous measurement results . if no tunneling electron is detected , the result is _ null _ , i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . if there is _ detection _ of a tunneling electron in time @xmath34 , then @xmath40 or @xmath41 . we can think of @xmath36 as the increment in the number of electrons @xmath42 passing through the right junction of the set into the drain in the infinitesimal time @xmath34 . it is the variable @xmath43 , the accumulated electron number transmitted through the set in the drain , which is used in refs . and . since the nature of detection results is classical and that of electrons tunneling through the set is stochastic , @xmath44 should represent a classical random process . the measurement record in each single run of experiment is the set of times @xmath45 and @xmath46 when electrons tunnel onto or off the set island , respectively [ i.e. , ones of @xmath35 and @xmath36 over the entire detection time ; see , e.g. , fig . [ fig : traj](i ) and ( j ) ] .    at first , one may expect that at the end of each time interval @xmath34 , there are four possible measurement outcomes , @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 \\ , [ 1-dn_{rc}(t)]$ ] , and @xmath50 . it is important to realize that a null result ( e.g. , @xmath51 ) in a time interval @xmath34 is still a measurement result or outcome . let us consider the case in the sequential tunneling dominated regime that the probability of electrons tunneling onto and off the set island within the same infinitesimal time interval @xmath34 is rather small . in fact , the respective probability of @xmath35 or @xmath36 equal to unity is proportional to @xmath34 [ see eqs . ( [ dnl ] ) and ( [ dnr ] ) ] . thus the product of @xmath52 occurs with probability proportional to @xmath53 . since we shall keep only terms to order @xmath34 in the master equations , we can neglect the case that @xmath35 and @xmath36 both equal one within the same infinitesimal time interval . the possible measurement outcomes then become : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath54 $ ] . the first two terms , in this case , represent that an electron tunneling event through , respectively , the left and right junctions of set is measured at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) . while the last term @xmath54 $ ] represents that no tunneling event is observed in [ @xmath55 ) . thus the conditioned density matrix @xmath56 to order @xmath34 at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) can be written as @xmath57 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1 cm } + dn_{rc}(t ) \\frac{w_{r1c}(t+dt)}{{\\rm tr}[w_{r1c}(t+dt ) ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1 cm } + [ 1-dn_{lc}(t)-dn_{rc}(t ) ] \\frac{w_{0c}(t+dt)}{{\\rm tr}[w_{0c}(t+dt ) ] } , \\label{conddm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the unnormalized density matrices , given that an electron tunneling event through left or right junction of the set island , or no tunneling event is measured at the end of the time interval [ @xmath55 ) . equation ( [ conddm ] ) simply states that when @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the normalized conditioned density matrix is @xmath63 $ ] , and so on . self - consistently , the ensemble averages @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] of the classical stochastic processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 should equal respectively the probabilities ( quantum average ) of electrons tunneling through the left and right junctions of the set island in time @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath64={\\rm tr}[w_{l1c}(t+dt)]$ ] and @xmath65={\\rm tr}[w_{r1c}(t+dt)]$ ] .    formally , we can write the currents through the junctions as @xmath66 , \\\\ i_{rc}(t)=e\\ , [ { dn_{rc}(t)}/{dt } ] . \\label{eq : currentr } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the question now is to find expressions for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 in the model . to do this , we derive the unconditional master equation and then use it to find @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .", "following the same assumptions and approximations in refs .   and and similar derivations in refs .   and , we first derive the master equation of `` partially '' reduced density matrix . by tracing out the microscopic degrees of freedom of the left and right leads and the island of the set , but keeping the electron transfer operators explicitly @xcite ( so that we can keep track of effects of electron tunneling events on the system density matrix ) , we obtain the born - markov master equation for the `` partially '' reduced density matrix operator @xmath67 of the scb / set system ( consisting of the qubit , and the island and drain of the set ) as : @xmath68&=&-({i}/{\\hbar } ) [ { \\cal h}_{\\rm qb}+{\\cal h}_{\\rm int } , { \\cal w}(t ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.3cm}+ \\gamma_{l } { \\cal d}[e^{i\\phi}(1-\\hat{n})]{\\cal w}(t )   + \\gamma'_{l } { \\cal d}[e^{i\\phi}\\hat{n}]{\\cal w}(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.3 cm } + \\gamma_{r } { \\cal d}[e^{-i\\phi}e^{i\\psi}(1-\\hat{n})]{\\cal w}(t )   + \\gamma'_{r } { \\cal d}[e^{-i\\phi}e^{i\\psi}\\hat{n}]{\\cal w}(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.3cm}-{(\\gamma_{l}+\\gamma'_{l } ) }   [ \\hat{n},[\\hat{n},e^{i\\phi}\\,{\\cal w}(t)\\,e^{-i\\phi}]]/2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1.3cm}-{(\\gamma_{r}+\\gamma'_{r } ) }   [ \\hat{n},[\\hat{n},e^{-i\\phi}e^{i\\psi}\\,{\\cal w}(t)\\,e^{-i\\psi}e^{i\\phi}]]/2 \\ ;

( [ dnl ] ) and ( [ dnr ] ) ] , while the measured electron tunneling events themselves condition the future evolution of the measured system [ see eqs.([condmen ] ) and ( [ condmen+1 ] ) ] in a self - consistent manner . each set of quantum trajectories ( stochastic state evolutions ) , obtained from the stochastic master equations ( [ condmen])-([dnr ] ) , mimics a single history of the qubit state in a single run of the continuous measurement experiment . the stochastic element in the quantum trajectories corresponds exactly to the consequence of the random outcomes of the detection record of the tunneling events in the set . the macroscopic ensemble measurement properties can be calculated by using large ensembles of single electron tunneling events ( fine grained measurement records ) . if only one measurement value is recorded in each run of experiments [ for example , the number of electrons @xmath1 that have tunneled into the right lead ( drain ) in time @xmath2 ] and ensemble average properties [ for example , @xmath0 , the probability distribution of finding @xmath130 electrons that have tunneled through the right junction into the drain in time @xmath2 ] are studied @xcite over many repeated experiments , the quantum trajectory approach will give the same result as the master equation approach of the `` partially '' reduced density matrix @xcite . however , more physical insight can be gained in the approach of quantum trajectories . we demonstrate this feature below . we consider the case that the scb / set system is in the so - called zeno regime @xcite where the mixing time is much larger than the measurement ( localization ) time . in this regime , a good quantum readout measurement for an initial qubit state in the charge - state basis can be performed by repeatedly measuring the number of electrons , @xmath131 , that have tunneled through the right junction into the drain of the set in the same detection time period @xmath2 . one can then use the measurement results to construct the probability distribution @xmath0 . in ref . , the probability distribution @xmath132 $ ] is obtained from the fourier analysis of the partially reduced density matrix , eq . ( [ mepartialm ] ) . the result , obtained in this way , is plotted in solid line in fig . [ fig : probnt ] . this probability distribution @xmath0 splits into two and their weights correspond closely to the initial qubit diagonal elements of @xmath133 and @xmath134 .    . the initial conditions and parameters are the same as those in fig . [ fig : traj ] . [ fig : probnt ] ]    in the quantum trajectory approach , @xmath0 can be explicitly simulated through constructing the histogram of the accumulated number of electrons @xmath135 up to time @xmath2 for many realizations of the detection records ( generated together with their corresponding quantum trajectories ) , and then normalizing the distribution to one . the simulation of the normalized histogram shown in fig . [ fig : probnt ] using @xmath136 quantum trajectories and their corresponding detection records is already in good agreement with the plot in solid line . however , the possible individual realizations of measurement records and their corresponding quantum trajectories [ e , g . , in fig . [ fig : traj ] ] do provide insight into , and aid in the interpretation of the ensemble average properties . this is one of the appealing features of the quantum trajectory approach .    for a charge qubit measured by a low - transparency point contact detector , this appealing feature of the quantum trajectories is illustrated in ref .  . another advantage of the quantum trajectory approach ( or bayesian formalism ) is that it may describe a quantum feedback process . it has been shown @xcite that one may utilize the measurement output for the feedback control and manipulation of a qubit state .", "to summarize , we have derived the stochastic master equation for the scb / set system , which can be regarded as a monte carlo method that allows us to simulate the continuous quantum measurement process of the scb qubit by the set . we have shown that by taking a `` partial '' average over the fine grained measurement records of the tunneling events in the set , this stochastic master equation reduces to the master equation presented in refs .   and . we have also presented numerical simulation for the dynamics of the qubit in a particular realization of the readout measurement experiment . we have shown that the probability distribution @xmath0 constructed from @xmath136 quantum trajectories and their corresponding detection records , is , as expected , in good agreement with that obtained from the fourier analysis of the `` partially '' reduced density matrix .                        the last term , @xmath137/2\\}dt$ ] , in eq .

[ f1 ] is the faraday rotation calculated from eq . ( [ far ] ) using the values in table ii . the dashed and dash - dotted lines show the contribution to the total faraday rotation from the octahedral and tetrahedral sites , respectively . note that below 2.2 ev , the main contribution to @xmath31 comes from the octahedral site .    the solid line in fig .

[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , respectively . the good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions confirm the validity of the model used here .", "if a light beam propagates along the z - axis through the magnetic film , then the polar faraday rotation of the film is given by ( neglecting the voigt - effect and multiple reflections)@xcite @xmath37 where the anisotropy field is defined by @xmath38 eq . ( [ f ] ) is only valid as long as the cubic anisotropy can be neglected . when @xmath39 , the faraday rotation is at its maximum value . as an example , the faraday rotation as a function of @xmath40 for sample 4 is shown in fig . note that the faraday rotation is accurately described by eq .

( [ ms ] ) , which indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy plays a minor role here . since the films of composition @xmath43 are well described by eq . ( [ ha ] ) , we will use this in the further modelling . film 7 , 8 and 12 are not well described by eq . ( [ ha ] ) , which is most probably due to their chemical composition . the faraday rotation sensitivity is given by @xmath47 it is useful to separate the contributions from bismuth and gallium . the contribution from bismuth can be written as @xmath48 the experimental data at 2.3 ev ( wavelength 540 nm ) are shown in fig . [ f7 ] together with the theoretical prediction based on eq . ( [ bi ] ) . a reasonably good agreement is obtained for all samples of composition @xmath43 , except sample 11 , which shows a minor deviation from the theoretical curve . we do not know the reason for this deviation . it is interesting to observe that the sensitivity depends linearly on the bismuth content . the experimental data for samples 7 , 8 and 12 ( diamond , circle and cross ) are located far from the straight line , since they do not follow eq . ( [ ha ] ) . it is also of interest to see how gallium influences the sensitivity of the material . to that end , we define @xmath49 in fig . [ f8 ] the experimental data are shown together with the theoretical prediction based on eq . ( [ ga ] ) . again we note that there is good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical curve for samples of composition @xmath43 ( except for sample 11 , which shows a minor deviation from the theoretical curve ) . now the sensitivity has a strong nonlinear dependence on the gallium content . thus , one may think that it should be possible to increase the sensitivity even further by adding more gallium . however , this is not the case . if we add more gallium ( above z=1.2 ) , the film approaches its compensation point ( @xmath50 ) where the coercivity of the material is rather high . on the other hand , it would be of interest to investigate the sensitivity above the compensation point , which is outside the scope of this paper .", "we have investigated the faraday rotation of in - plane magnetized bismuth - substituted ferrite garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy on ( 100 ) oriented gadolinium gallium garnet substrates . the faraday spectra were measured for photon energies between 1.7 - 2.6 ev . to interprete the spectra , we use a simple model based on two electric dipole transitions , and find excellent agreement with the experimental data . furthermore , the faraday rotation sensitivity was measured at 2.3 ev , and found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predicitions . in particular , we find that the sensitivity increases linearly with the bismuth content and nonlinearly with the gallium content ."]}

( [ psi_1 ] ) @xmath20 . updating equations for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 were constructed in a similar way . the dynamics of a dirac electron can now be studied in any environment described by a four - potential @xmath24 regardless of its complexity and time dependency . in this paper we studied the dynamics defined by the vector potential @xmath25 . the dirac equation is a differential equation of the first order and linear in @xmath26 . as in the case of maxwell s equations , the entire dynamics of the electron is defined , only by its initial wave function . the dynamics of a wave packet used in this paper was defined by the initial wave function of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28^{-1/2}$ ] is a normalizing constant . ( [ wave_packet ] ) represents a wave packet whose initial probability distribution is of a normalized gaussian shape . its size is defined by the constant @xmath29 , its spin is pointed along the z - axis , and its motion is defined by the values of the momenta @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . some consequences of the initial localization of the wave packet on the overall dynamics of the electron were studied in ref . @xcite .", "the dynamics of a wave packet is very complex . the dynamics of a particle described by the wave packet in eq . ( [ wave_packet ] ) depends on its localization , defined by the gaussian component of the wave function , and its initial momentum , part of the wave function s phase . while an extensive study was done on the dynamics of the wave packet related to the scalar component @xmath32 of a four - potential @xcite , such a study does not validate the dynamics of the wave packet related to the vector component of a four - potential @xmath33 .    applying the fdtd method to study the dynamics of a wave packet in a vector potential associated with a strong uniform magnetic field is not difficult . classically , the dynamics consist of uniform rotational motion . in the relativistic quantum - mechanical description , however , even such a simple dynamics can validate the fdtd computation only up to a certain level . as pointed out in ref . @xcite `` the dynamics is particularly rich and not adequately described by semiclassical approximations '' . in ref . @xcite it was demonstrated that in the presence of an external magnetic field the wave packet splits into two parts which rotate with different cyclotron frequencies , and after a few periods , the motion acquires irregular character . as a result of such a complex dynamics , when comparing the results obtained by the fdtd method and the computation described in ref . @xcite and @xcite , we could not expect more than a qualitative agreement . in addition to this qualitative agreement , of equal importance to the validation of the computation is the consistency of the results obtained for different vector potential gauges .    in this paper , the motion of the wave packet described by eq . ( [ wave_packet ] ) was studied in a uniform magnetic field oriented along the y - axis    @xmath34    for this field the corresponding vector potential in a rotationally invariant gauge was @xmath35 the dynamics of the wave packet was obtained by solving the dirac equation for this vector potential . while the probability densities @xmath36 were calculated for the entire computational volume and at every time step , their values are shown here only on two planes , the horizontal or plane of classical particle motion , and the plane vertical to the plane of motion . the schematics of the planes relative to the wave packet motion and the orientation of the magnetic field are shown in fig [ fig : planes_unif_field ] . the position and the shape of the wave packet in the horizontal plane , as it moves along its first orbit , is shown in figure [ fig : first_orbit_unif_field ] . the initial position of the wave packet was at the center of the vector potential . its initial momentum was @xmath37 , making the motion relativistic . in order to force a relativistic electron to complete a full circle in the available computational space , the magnitude of the magnetic field was @xmath38 . the field of such a strength is associated with the fields at the surface of the neutron stars . the classical orbit of the electron in this field is @xmath39 . as shown in figure [ fig : first_orbit_unif_field ] , during the first rotation the wave packet generally follows the classical orbit and disperses at the same time . the position of the center of probability of the wave packet relative to the classical orbit is shown in fig [ fig : first_orbit_position_cprob ] . the complexity of the dynamics of the wave packet increased in the later stages of the motion . while the wave packet followed the circular motion , the probability density @xmath36 at some times assumed the spiral shape shown in figure [ fig : spiral_orbit_unif_field ] , increased or reduced its length , changed its rotational motion , and translated from one place to another . overall , the characteristics of this dynamics were similar to the characteristics described in ref . @xcite and @xcite . while the figures show some of the complex shapes of the probability density @xmath36 , the richness of the electron motion can be better appreciated through the animation of the dynamics accessible on - line @xcite . there was no intention of this validation to study the property of the confinement of the electron by the electrostatic potential . but , by using a scalar potential @xmath40 at the boundaries of the computational volume to limit the electron motion in the direction of the magnetic field , due to the wave packet dispersion , we have inadvertently also solved the dirac equation for the confined electron . we reported @xcite that , contrary to the claim of the klein paradox , there was no penetration of the wave packet into a potential barrier of a supercritical potential of height @xmath41 satisfying the condition @xmath42 . the time evaluation of the solution of the dirac equation shown in figure [ fig : circ_mot_vert_cut ] confirms this result . figure [ fig : circ_mot_vert_cut ] shows that the electron wave function , as the wave packet disperses and reaches a non - penetrable electrostatic potential , creates a bound state . reduction of number of nodes in a bound state solution could be interpreted as a transition of the particle from the higher energy state into the lover energy state as it orbits in a uniform magnetic field . several additional tests of the fdtd method were performed using the dynamics of the electron in the uniform magnetic field . as expected , due to the normal spin and the magnetic field orientation , reversal of the orientation of the magnetic field resulted in the reversal of the direction of the rotation of the wave packet , keeping the same properties of the dynamics of motion . of particular interest was testing the effects of the choice of gauge . the motion of the same wave packet was also studied for the uniform magnetic field oriented along the y - axis defined by the translationally invariant gauges @xmath43 or @xmath44    in both cases the wave packet persisted in a circular motion following the classical orbit . while the dynamics of the wave packet behaved as expected , using translationally invariant gauges has an additional importance on validating the fdtd computation . as seen in eq . ( [ psi_1 ] ) , the gauge in eq . ( [ uni_mag_potent_x ] ) couples to the @xmath23 component and the gauge in eq . ( [ uni_mag_potent_z ] ) couples to the @xmath22 component . similarly , the cross coupling exists for other components of the wave function @xmath45 . as a result , the same dynamics should be obtained by different combinatorics of the components of the vector potential and the components of the wave function . this enabled for testing of possible inconsistencies in the fdtd updating equations . no inconsistencies were found . the dynamics of the wave packet motion in a uniform magnetic field was used here only as a validation of the fdtd method when a vector potential was applied in the dirac equation . the same complexity of the quantum dynamics of motion as in previous publications @xcite was shown . while used here only for computational validation of the fdtd method , this dynamics could be studied as a separate problem in more detail in the future . finally , the complexity of the quantum dynamics of the wave packet in a uniform magnetic field studied here for three choices of gauge could be fully appreciated only by downloading the related animations @xcite .", "the goal of this work is to study the dynamics of an electron wave packet under the influence of a vector potential associated with the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite . particularly , in this paper we present the dynamics of a wave packet obtained from the solution of the dirac equation with a vector potential created by two infinite solenoids . the vector potential of a single infinite solenoid oriented along the y - axis can be written as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the magnetic flux inside the solenoid , @xmath48 defines the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath49 is the radius of the solenoid , and @xmath50 is the distance from the center of the solenoid in the x - z plane . outside two parallel infinite solenoids separated by a distance @xmath51 and with opposite magnetic field orientation , the vector potential is then    @xmath52    an example of the shape of this potential is shown in figure [ fig : plot_of_vector_potential ] . outside the solenoids , the associated magnetic fields @xmath53 of the vector potentials described by eqs . ( [ vect_pot_inf_solenoid ] ) and ( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) are zero . the time - dependent dirac equation is now solved for the scalar component of the four - potential @xmath54 and the vector component @xmath55 defined by eq . ( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) . with this choice we can study the dynamics of the wave packet in the region where the electric and the magnetic fields are zero . obviously , in this region the lorentz force acting on the electron , @xmath56 , is also zero . the dynamics of the electron motion between two infinite and parallel solenoids is essentially the same as the electron dynamics in the case of aharonov - bohm effect . in both cases the electron moves in a field free region with no lorentz force acting on it . because of the symmetry , however , the dynamics in the case of two infinite solenoids consists only of the motion along one straight line between the solenoids . this avoids the complications of the aharonov - bohm dynamics where the trajectories on opposite sides of a single solenoid are compared . because the properties of the dynamics are not studied through an interference , in the case of two solenoids the changes in the dynamics of the electron wave packet exclude the contribution of the nonlocal properties of the electron wave function dependent on the topology of the space . another advantage of using two solenoids and localized wave packet is the possibility to separate the solenoids far enough that no parts of the wave packet penetrate the non - zero field region inside the solenoids , excluding this contribution to the dynamics as well . if necessary , the solenoids could be shielded by a potential barrier of a supercritical potential additionally preventing any penetration of the wave packet into non - zero field region . the motion of the wave packet between the solenoids , in the plane normal to the orientation of the solenoids , is shown in figure [ fig : wave_two_solenoids ] . the wave packet was initially positioned away from center of the solenoids . the dynamics was studied for two initial momenta , @xmath37 or @xmath57 . the solenoids were separated by a distance of @xmath58 and the magnitude of the magnetic flux inside each of them was @xmath59 . as shown in figure [ fig : wave_two_solenoids ] , and in the related animation , the wave packet moved between two solenoids along a straight line , dispersing in time in the direction normal to the direction of motion . since , classically , there was no force acting on the electron , one should have expected a constant velocity of the wave packet along the straight line . this was not the case . the velocity of the wave packet , shown in figure [ fig : two_solenoids_velocity ] as a function of the position , increased as the packet approached the solenoids and decreased as the packet left the solenoids . it is somewhat paradoxical that while there was , classically , no force acting on the electron , the electron acceleration , obtained strictly as a solution of the dirac equation , was not zero . in the next section we will show that this paradox can be resolved .", "the controversy in the previous section , resulting from the solution of the dirac equation , can be understood if we look again at the basic principles of classical mechanics . the motion of a particle in the absence of a force in classical dynamics is obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the momentum of a particle . the solution of this equation results in a constant velocity of the particle . the solution of the dirac equation shows that , even if the force acting on the particle is zero , the velocity of the particle changes . to resolve the discrepancy between classical dynamics and the dirac equation we need to look at the basics of how the dirac equation of an electron is obtained .    in obtaining the dirac equation from classical dynamics , the classical momentum @xmath62 becomes a momentum operator @xmath63 . if the electron is in a given external field the momentum operator is replaced by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the charge of the electron @xcite . this replacement not only is not self - evident , but must be done in the first order equations @xcite . going backward from the dirac equation into classical dynamics , one replaces the classical momentum @xmath66 . in the lagrangian mechanics , the momentum @xmath67 is called the generalized or canonical momentum @xcite . by proper use of momentum conservation @xcite , the motion of an electron in the absence of a classical force can now be obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath68 since @xmath69 does not explicitly depend on time , for the motion along the x - axis , eq . ( [ general_no_force ] ) can be written as @xmath70 in the relativistic case @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the rest mass of the electron . using eqs . ( [ general_no_force ] ) and ( [ rel_momentum ] ) we get the differential equation for the velocity of the electron @xmath73 due to the relativistic motion , in the system of the solenoids the velocity differential @xmath74 has to be substituted with @xmath75 . this leads to the final form of the differential equation @xmath76 substituting @xmath69 from the eq . ( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) for @xmath77 , electron motion along the mid - path between two solenoids , the differential equation for the velocity of the electron becomes @xmath78 where @xmath79 is half the distance between two parallel infinite solenoids . this differential equation can be solved numerically . figure [ fig : theory_two_solenoids_velocity ] shows a nearly perfect match between the solution of eq . ( [ rel_diff_eq_final ] ) and the solution of the dirac equation . a small difference , a fraction of a percent , is the result of the numerical precision and the fact that in classical dynamics we calcute propagation of a particle , not a wave packet , therefore having no contribution of the localization to the initial condition .    in a little digression from the main point of this paper , we can show that the above application of the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum is not an exception . one can easily show that for the translationally invariant gauges , eqs . ( [ uni_mag_potent_x ] ) and ( [ uni_mag_potent_z ] ) , the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum is equivalent to the lorentz force . without changing the general result , for ease of calculation , we assume that the electric field @xmath80 and the vector potential @xmath55 is time independent . the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum , eq . ( [ general_no_force ] ) , for the dynamics of an electron in a uniform magnetic field defined by the translationally invariant gauges , can now be rewritten as @xmath81 eq . ( [ general_lorentz ] ) shows that the lorentz force is just a consequence of generalized or canonical momentum conservation . while not in such an explicit form , similar results were obtained by semon and taylor @xcite .    in a somewhat different way the same can be shown for the rotationally invariant gauge , eq . ( [ uni_mag_potent ] ) . in this case we use conservation of the canonical angular momentum @xmath82 @xmath83 represents classical angular momentum ( [ general_angular ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath84 repeating the same algebra , but using the rotationally invariant gauge of the vector potential @xmath55 , we get @xmath85 @xmath86 is again the lorentz force . with this we have shown the equivalence of the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum and canonical angular momentum , and the action of lorentz force for all vector potential gauges of the uniform magnetic field .    to conclude this section , we can look at the ongoing question if the aharonov - bohm effect is the result of a force changing the velocity of a particle passing on opposite sides of a single infinitely long solenoid , or there is only a quantum - mechanical phase shift @xcite . quantum - mechanically such a question does not exist . the dynamics of the relativistic electron should be obtained only as a solution of the time - dependent dirac equation . the solution of the dirac equation shows that the velocity of a wave packet changes even in the region where the magnetic field is zero . since the change of the velocity depends on the gradient of the vector potential , the velocity of the wave packet passing on the opposite sides of the solenoid will be different . giving to the solution of the dirac equation a classical picture , the requirement of the conservation of the canonical momentum in the region where the magnetic field is zero but the vector potential is not zero , also results in a velocity change of a charged particle . no mechanical forces need to be present in order for the velocity of the particle to change . from both , the solution of the dirac equation and from the equivalence of the conservation of canonical momentum and the action of the lorentz - force , one can also see that no work was done on the particle . the particle exits with the same energy regardless on which side of the solenoid it passed .    from the studies presented in this paper , the classical picture of the aharonov - bohm effect consists of the phase shift in the wave function of the particles passing on opposite sides of a solenoid being attributed to time lag resulting from different evolution of the velocities of the particles , without any involvement of mechanical forces and any change in energy . a phase shift then results in an interference pattern .", "in conclusion , the full three - dimensional finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method was developed to solve the dirac equation . in this paper , the method was applied to the dynamics of the electron wave packet in a vector potential in the arrangements associated with the aharonov - bohm effect . the solution of the dirac equation showed that the velocity of the electron wave packet changed even in the region where the electric and the magnetic fields were zero , and therefore no force acted on the electron . the solution of the dirac equation agreed with the prediction of classical dynamics under the assumption that the dynamics were defined by the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum . it was shown that in the case of a uniform magnetic field , the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum was equivalent to the action of the lorentz force . the studies in this paper have helped to establish a classical picture of the aharonov - bohm effect as the interference pattern resulting from the phase shift in the wave function of the particles passing on opposite sides of a solenoid attributed to a time lag resulting from different evolution of the velocities of the particles . no mechanical forces need to be involved and no change in energy of the particle occurs .", "i would like to thank dentcho genov , b. ramu ramachandran , lee sawyer , ray sterling and steve wells for useful comments . also , the use of the high - performance computing resources provided by louisiana optical network initiative ( loni ;

( g ) @xmath14 ( similar to @xmath15).,width=321 ]    in this paper , we theoretically investigate spin - resolved currents flowing in large - area graphene , doped with single atoms of noble metals ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and @xmath3-transition metals ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7 ) . we study the adsorption both in pristine graphene as well as in monovacancies and divacancies , and we show that the current polarization is not monotonically correlated to the local magnetic moment . instead , it depends on the presence of localized levels near the fermi energy which strongly couple ( and thus hybridize ) to the graphene @xmath8 bands . we also show that a gate potential can be used to tune the energy of these localized levels , leading to an external way to control the degree of spin - polarized current without the application of a magnetic field .    in fig . [ fig1 ] ( a ) we show the setup of the devices we considered in this work , and in panels ( b)-(g ) we show the representative geometries for the complexes of metals adsorbed in graphene , both pristine and with defects ( metal@defect ) . the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the methodology we used . in the subsequent section , we present our results , discussing the total energy calculations , the current polarization , the dependence on the doping concentration , and the effect of a gate potential . in the last section we present our conclusions .", "( color online ) schematic representation of the unitary cell in the real ( a ) and reciprocal ( b ) spaces , where we define the symmetry points used to plot the energy bands.,width=321 ]    in order to obtain the geometries and electronic structure , we employ total energy density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) calculations . all geometries were fully relaxed using a force criteria of @xmath16ev /    with the siesta code@xcite . all calculations were carried out applying the generalized gradient approximation as parameterized by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof@xcite ( gga - pbe ) for the exchange correlation functional ( @xmath17 ) . we do not consider the spin - orbit coupling , because such interaction may locally open small band gaps@xcite , of the order of few milli electron volts , which will be a small effect when compared to the single - impurity scattering effects investigated in this paper . a localized double-@xmath18 polarized basis , an electronic temperature of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for the grid cut - off were used . most of our results were obtained with a rectangular @xmath21 graphene supercell , as schematically shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) . the integration in the brillouin zone was done with the monkhorst - pack@xcite scheme corresponding to a @xmath22 sampling in the unitary cell . a vacuum of @xmath23   was used between the periodic images of graphene sheets to avoid undesirable interactions . the directions between the symmetry points defined in fig . [ fig2 ] ( b ) were used to plot the energy bands . once the relaxed geometries were obtained , we calculated the transport properties with the transampa code @xcite . this code makes use of the non equilibrium green s function techniques coupled to dft in a fully self - consistent way with the bttiker - landauer formalism@xcite within the non interacting approach of meir wingreen@xcite . within this formalism , the translational symmetry along the transport direction is broken . however , in the transversal direction , due to the periodicity of the infinite 2d - system , the bloch theorem is still usable . in order to take into account a truly 2d graphene sheet , we implement the transport equations with transversal periodicity , considering @xmath24-points perpendicular to the transport direction ( @xmath25 ) . in the transport calculations , the relaxed geometries were sandwiched between two buffer layers to guarantee that the scattering region has a pristine - like coupling with the leads . we used the same simulation parameters of the siesta calculations , with exception of the @xmath24-points sampling . here , for the electronic density , we used the equivalent of 48 @xmath25-points in the unitary cell , whereas for the transmittance , 5000 @xmath25-points are necessary for a smooth behavior . this number of @xmath24-points is sufficient to capture the true 2d - character of graphene . in each step of the self - consistent field cycle , we calculated the electronic density with an integral in the complex plane discretized in 60 energy points and 5 poles . when a bias potential was applied , the non equilibrium contribution for the electronic density was calculated with an integral discretized in 200 energy points . we also implement the effect of a gate potential with strength `` @xmath26 '' by adding to the hamiltonian a function @xmath27 that depends only on the @xmath28 coordinate , given by :    @xmath29 \\right\\ } & , 0<z - z_{1}<\\tau \\\\ v_{gate } & , z_{1}+\\tau < z < z_{2}-\\tau \\\\                                    \\frac{v_{gate}}{2}\\left\\ { 1+cos\\left [ \\frac{\\pi(z_2-\\tau - z)}{\\tau } \\right ] \\right\\ } & , -\\tau < z - z_2<0.\\\\ \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath28 is the transport direction , the above function affects only a region between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( gated region ) and is continuous up to its first derivative . this region encloses the metal and the defect in our simulations , and we verified that the buffer - layer regions were not affected by this gate . the @xmath32 parameter controls the smoothness of the connections between the gated and non - gated regions , and we used @xmath33   for a smooth behavior . it is also important to mention that the gate effect is included in the whole self - consistent - field procedure , and the electronic density rearrangement creates a screening effect , in the sense that ( for example ) @xmath34 will not necessarily shift the energy levels by @xmath35 . this implementation is in the same spirit of refs . and .", "ccccc & m@pristine & m@mv & m@585 & m@555777 +    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the relaxed geometries , local magnetic moments ( @xmath36 ) and binding energies ( @xmath37 ) are shown in table [ tab1 ] . our results compare well with previous calculations@xcite . this is also true for the adsorption of noble metals on pristine graphene , where van der waals interactions are important@xcite . however , in these cases , the energies obtained for the different configurations with our methodology are all very similar . thus , to select which adsorption site to use in the charge transport calculations [ b position in fig . [ fig1](b ) ] , we used the results of ref . . for atoms trapped in the mv , all relaxations lead to geometries similar to @xmath9 [ depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] ( c ) ] . however , the transition metals have a @xmath38 local symmetry , whereas for the noble metals this symmetry is destroyed by a structural distortion , breaking the spin degeneracies of localized states near the fermi level , leading to @xmath39 , as discussed in ref . . for adsorption on dvs , we considered two particular reconstructions studied in the literature@xcite , the 585 and 555777 . for atoms trapped in 585 dvs , we find a @xmath40 local symmetry in all cases , with the atoms displaced from the graphene plane , similar to @xmath10 , as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( d ) . all the @xmath3 transition metals adsorbed on the 555777 dv present a non - zero local magnetic moment , with the energetically most favorable position being above the central atom of this defect , as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( e ) . it is worth noting that ( i ) @xmath7 has a non zero local magnetic moment solely when trapped in this site and ( ii ) adsorption of adatoms has been experimentally observed in them@xcite . the noble metals , on the other hand , have a completely different behavior , presenting a zero local magnetic moment when adsorbed on the 555777 dv . the lowest energy configuration for @xmath13 is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( f ) , with the gold atom at the top of a carbon atom belonging to a pentagon . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the lowest energy position is above the center of a heptagon , as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ( g ) . however , @xmath0 presents a @xmath41 local symmetry , whereas @xmath1 presents five different chemical bond lengths .

[ fig3 ] ( a ) we show the current polarization , cp=@xmath43 , for all studied cases , where the current for each spin channel ( @xmath44 ) is @xmath45de$ ] , with @xmath46 the transmittance for the spin @xmath47 , @xmath48 the fermi - dirac function , and @xmath49 the chemical potential for the left ( right ) electrodes . a bias potential of @xmath50 was used . clearly , @xmath6 and @xmath5 adsorbed on pristine graphene generate the higher cp in the systems we consider . however , the metal diffusion experimentally observed creates a drawback to build devices with adatoms over pristine graphene since in the most cases the atoms tend to clusterize . for the atoms trapped in defects , the higher values of cp ( in modulus ) occurs for the @xmath12 , followed by @xmath10 . the last one has a negative cp because localized levels above the fermi - energy scatter majority spins , generating a current with excess of minority spin electrons . one should note that , despite the high magnetization of all @xmath4 complexes , the absolute values of cp are not so remarkable in such systems . in particular , the @xmath51 has a negligible cp , even though it has @xmath52 . for the noble metals , an unusual local magnetic moment generated by the polarization of `` @xmath53 '' atomic orbitals leads to cp smaller than @xmath54 . these results indicate that the existence of a local magnetic moment is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have a large cp . this can be clearly seen in the fig . [ fig3 ] ( b ) , where we show the cp as a function of the local magnetic moment , showing that there is no correlation between the local magnetic moment and the current polarization . in fig . [ fig3 ] ( c ) we show the cp as a function of the magnetic moment induced only in the graphene carbon atoms . this magnetization occurs due to the hybridization between the graphene states and the adatom orbitals . however , this hybridization may occur ( i ) at deep levels , not affecting the cp , or ( ii ) near the fermi energy , affecting the transmission probability near the transport window . therefore we conclude that the cp behavior is not governed solely by the magnetic moment induced in graphene , but depends fundamentally on the energy window where the hybridization responsible for the appearance of such a magnetic moment occurs . ( color online ) band structure and spin - resolved transmittance for ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath55 , ( c ) and ( d ) @xmath6 over pristine graphene , ( e ) and ( f ) ni@555777 . the solid ( dashed ) lines correspond to the majority ( minority ) spin channels . for the sake of comparison , we also show the transmittance for pristine graphene . the smooth behavior of all curves indicates the convergence , regarding the @xmath25-points , to the true 2d - nature of graphene . in the energy bands , we also indicate the position of the dirac cone ( with a vertical dashed line ) , corresponding to the @xmath56 symmetry point in a hexagonal supercell . , width=321 ]    in order to understand the ruling factors that govern the current polarization , we performed band structure calculations . from these results , we conclude that the degree of current spin polarization is governed by ( i ) the presence of localized levels , non degenerated in spin , nearby the fermi level and ( ii ) by their hybridization with graphene levels . to illustrate these conclusions we present in detail three representative cases shown in fig . [ fig4 ] . in panel ( a ) we plot the energy bands for the @xmath55 complex . in this situation , there is a flat band around @xmath57 below the fermi energy , with majority spin associated with au `` s '' atomic orbitals , which is responsible for the local magnetic moment of @xmath58 . this band does not modify the shape of the dirac cone because it has a weak coupling to the graphene @xmath8 bands . as a consequence , the transmission probability [ @xmath59 shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( b ) is very similar to the pristine case around the fermi energy . this example shows that a magnetic moment and localized states near the fermi energy are a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition to generate spin - polarized currents in graphene , as discussed above . in fact , to generate current polarizations it is also necessary to have a high coupling between the localized levels and graphene @xmath8 bands , modifying in this way the transmission probability for only one or both spin channels . as an example of modifications in only one spin channel , we show the energy bands for the @xmath6 adsorbed on pristine graphene in fig . [ fig4 ] ( c ) . it is notable that a dirac cone is well defined only for the majority spin . for the minority spin , localized levels hybridize with the dirac cone states , and hence significantly modify the dispersion of these states . as a result , the transmittance [ shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( d ) ] is very similar to the one in pristine graphene only for the majority spin , causing in this way a high current polarization . for the @xmath12 complex there are modifications in the band structure for both spin channels [ see fig . [ fig4 ] ( e ) ] . in this case , the local magnetic moment comes from localized states around the fermi energy with a high hybridization with the dirac cone . as a consequence , the transmittance for both spin channels , shown in fig . [ fig4 ] ( f ) , are not only distinct from the pristine case , but also very different between them . in this system we still observe a flat band at @xmath60 above the fermi energy . however , as there is a weak coupling with the dirac cone states , there is almost no change in @xmath61 . therefore , the examples shown in fig . [ fig4 ] elucidate the conditions to have spin - polarized currents in graphene generated by doping with magnetic impurities .      in most calculations we performed the distance between the metallic adatom and its periodic image is @xmath62 . in order to understand the effect of the doping concentration we calculated the transmittance for @xmath51 also for supercells of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65   wide , as shown in fig . [ fig5 ] . the main characteristic of @xmath51 transmittance is a valley in the minority spin transmittance around @xmath66 above the fermi energy , and another valley for the majority spin transmittance around @xmath67 below the fermi energy . with the widening of the supercell , the valleys became more localized , as a reflect of the decrease in the energy dispersion of the defect levels . however , the main results obtained with the smaller supercell are unchanged . ( color online ) spin - resolved transmittance for @xmath51 . the distance between @xmath4 atoms are @xmath68 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65   in ( a)-(d ) , respectively.,width=321 ]      we also show that it is possible to control the current polarization via the effect of a gate potential . as an example , we show in fig . [ fig6 ] the transport properties for the @xmath51 complex , as a function of @xmath26 . in panel ( a ) we present the spin - resolved currents . without a gate potential the current polarization is negligible . however , with the inclusion of a negative gate the current has excess of majority spin electrons , whereas with a positive gate there are excess of minority spin electrons . this behavior occurs because the gate potential shifts the localized states that hybridize with the graphene @xmath8 bands , as shown in figs . [ fig6](b)-[fig6](f ) , allowing a tuning of the valleys in the transmittance ( indicated by vertical lines ) . in fig . [ fig6](g ) , we also present cp as a function of @xmath26 . it is remarkable that cp can be changed from @xmath69 to @xmath70 with the application of a gate . therefore , without any external magnetic perturbation , it is possible to control the degree of spin polarization in such systems .

gordon equation in momentum basis @xcite . the solution of the scalar field on the de sitter spacetime is correctly normalized and forms a complete set as was shown in @xcite . by @xmath6 we denote the solution of positive frequency @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hankel function of the first kind and @xmath9 . the solution of negative frequency is @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , the modes defined above behave as a positive / negative frequency modes with respect to the conformal time @xmath12 : @xmath13[bd ] which is the behavior in the infinite past for positive / negative frequency modes which defines the bunch - davies vacuum . the expression of the transition amplitude for pair production is obtained using perturbational methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and has the following form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coupling constant between fields and @xmath16 . + for our study we have to find the form of the electric field on de sitter geometry . we specify that we use the electric field produced by a point charge in this geometry . this can be done easily if we take into consideration the conformal invariance of maxwell equations @xcite . the vector potential in de sitter geometry can be expressed in terms of the vector potential from flat space as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 @xcite . if we consider @xmath19 , then the vector potential that produce the electric field has the following form : @xmath20 where @xmath21 gives the orientation of the electric field . + if we look carefully at the solution of the klein - gordon equation , we observe that , the index of the hankel function , @xmath22 can also become real when @xmath23 . this case contain the case when the expansion factor was large comparatively with the particle mass , which could be interesting if we want to address the problem of particle production in the early universe . in this case the index @xmath24  of the hankel function , will become : @xmath25 . our calculations for the amplitude of the scalar particle production on the de sitter spacetime will be done with both solutions of real and imaginary index of the klein - gordon equation and the results will be compared . the relation between the two indices of the hankel function is very simple : @xmath26 . in this circumstances the solution of the scalar field with hankel function being real is : @xmath27 using the above solutions of the klein - gordon equation and the vector potential given by ( [ c1 ] ) , with @xmath28 , the expression of the transition amplitude becomes : @xmath29 where the volume element is @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denotes the proper time . the spatial integral is easy to solve if we consider spherical coordinates . using the formula @xmath32 from appendix , the expression of this integral is : @xmath33 if we use a new type of variable @xmath34 , the temporal integral becomes : @xmath35 in order to obtain the expression of the temporal integral it is necessary to make a few steps . first , we express the hankel function with the help of macdonald function , using the formula @xmath36 from appendix . then we use @xmath37 to solve the new integral , and finally , we use the relation @xmath38 between the hypergeometric function @xmath39 and gamma -

euler functions are well defined and have no poles . from eq.@xmath51 it is easy to see that , the amplitude of pair production in the presence of an electric field is nonzero only when the momenta of the particles are not equal . as we can see from eq.@xmath51 and eq.@xmath52 the final expression of the transition amplitude depends on the heaviside step function , gamma - euler function and hypergeometric gauss function . the hypergeometric function becomes divergent if the ratio @xmath53 is @xmath54 . in consequence , the law of momentum conservation is not respected in this case . we know that , the de sitter metric is invariant under spatial translations , and the momentum is conserved . so the fact that , the law of momentum conservation is broken in this process is due to the external electric field .      the transition amplitude for pair production in external electric field , for the imaginary case , can be calculated using the same methods like in the real case . a quick method to obtain the final expression of the amplitude of pair production is to make the substitution @xmath56 in the previous result . with this replacement the transition amplitude is : @xmath57,\\label{re1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath58 has the expression : @xmath59\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the next section , we will use this result to calculate the probability of pair production in the limit @xmath60 . this amplitude corresponds to the case when the particle mass is larger than the hubble constant .", "because , in the previous section , we discussed two cases of the transition amplitude , one corresponding to a situation with large expansion factor @xmath61 and one corresponding to small expansion factor in comparison with particle mass @xmath62 , we also have to study the corresponding probabilities of pair production for these two cases . also , another important thing at this section , will be the graphical representation of the density probability of pair production as a function of @xmath63 . from this graphs we want to give a correct interpretation of our analytical results . + if we square the scattering amplitude , we obtain the probability density of transition : @xmath64 the probability density of pair production for @xmath23 , has the following form : @xmath65.\\label{p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total probability is obtained by integrating after the final momenta the probability formula ( [ p1 ] ) . these integrals are complicated and we restrict to study the properties of the density of probability . further , we plot the probability density of scalar particle production as a function of parameter @xmath66 , for different values of @xmath67 . here @xmath68 and @xmath69 represents the momenta of the particle , respectively of the antiparticle . we observe that , the function @xmath70 , which defines the probability , depends on @xmath25 . so , the numerical values taken by @xmath63 are in the interval @xmath71 $ ] , since this interval include the interesting case of large expansion factor relatively to the particle mass .    , for @xmath72 . ]    , for @xmath73 . ]    , for @xmath74 . ] our graphs show that , the probability density of pair production is very important in the limit @xmath75 , which corresponds to the early universe . also we can observe that , the density of probability is increasing as the ratio @xmath67 is decreasing . this means that it is more probable to produce pairs in which one particle has a small momenta , in comparison with the momenta of the other particle . our result show that only when the expansion factor is larger than the mass of the particle the probability of pair production is significant . this result show that the probability of particle production was important only in the early universe . our result is in agreement with parker s results @xcite , even if we use another method to study the problem of particle production . the probability density of pair production for the case @xmath60 , is obtained by squaring the amplitude ( [ re1 ] ) : @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] like in the previous case we want to make a graphical representation of the density of probability as a function of @xmath63 , for different values of @xmath67 . but this time , the numerical values of @xmath63 are taken in the interval @xmath77 , this being the interval where the solutions of the klein - gordon equation with imaginary index are correctly defined . these results are presented in the following graphs :    , for @xmath78 . ]    , for @xmath72 . ]    , for @xmath74 . ]    from our graphs we see that , the probability density of scalar particle production in the limit @xmath60 is much smaller if we compare with the case @xmath23 . the conclusion of this result is the following : the process of scalar particle production from vacuum in the presence of an external electric field , was important only in the early universe . as we can observe from our graphs figs.([fig:1])-([fig:3 ] ) in the minkowski limit when @xmath79 our probabilities vanish . the minkowski limit can also be obtained analytically from our results for the amplitude ( probability ) . + further we want to discuss the problem of particle - antiparticle separation . our results show that , in both cases the probability densities of pair production are proportional with the term @xmath80^{2}}{|\\vec{p}+\\vec{p}\\,'|^2}$ ] . let us consider an arbitrary orientation of momentum vectors , and see what happens with the transition probability density . the spherical coordinates of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath21 are : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and respectively @xmath85 . then we obtain : @xmath86^{2}}{|\\vec{p}+\\vec{p}\\,'|^2}&= & \\frac{1}{(p^{2}+p\\,'^{2}+2pp\\,'\\cos\\gamma)}\\left[(p\\,'\\sin{\\alpha}\\cos{\\beta}-p\\sin{\\delta}\\cos{\\rho})\\sin{\\tau}\\cos{\\sigma}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+ ( p\\,'\\sin{\\alpha}\\sin{\\beta}-p\\sin{\\delta}\\sin{\\rho } ) \\sin{\\tau}\\sin{\\sigma}+(p\\,'\\cos{\\alpha}-p\\cos{\\delta})\\cos{\\tau}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the expression @xmath87 we can consider several particular cases of the orientation of momentum vectors and the unit vector @xmath21 , which gives the orientation of the electric field . for example , if @xmath88 , the probability density of pair production is minimum . this is the case when the two particles are emitted in the direction of the electric field but their momenta are parallel and have the same orientation with electric field vector . the probability density is also minimum if the pair is emitted on the direction of the electric field , but the momenta vectors are parallel and opposite in orientation relatively to the electric field vector . this is the situation when @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . in both cases when the density of probability is minimum , it is more likely that the pair will annihilate in vacuum . the minimum density of probability will be proportional with : @xmath91^{2}}{|\\vec{p}+\\vec{p}\\,'|^2}=\\frac{(p - p\\,')^{2}}{p^{2}+p\\,'^{2}+2pp\\,'}\\ ] ] contrary to this , we have maximum probability of emission for @xmath92 and @xmath93 . this is an important case , because it shows how the particle is separated from antiparticle . this is the case when the particles are emitted on the direction of electric field , their momenta are parallel and have opposite orientation . the maximum density of probability will be proportional with : @xmath94^{2}}{|\\vec{p}+\\vec{p}\\,'|^2}=\\frac{(p+p\\,')^{2}}{p^{2}+p\\,'^{2}-2pp\\,'}\\ ] ]    also , is important to mention that in the case when @xmath95 and @xmath96 the probability density of pair production is zero . this means that it is not possible for the pair to be emitted perpendicular on the direction of the electric field .", "we have studied here the scalar particle production , from vacuum in the presence of an electric field on de the sitter expanding universe . we were able to express the final result of the transition amplitude with the help of the heaviside step function , gamma - euler function and the hypergeometric function @xmath39 . this result shows that , the momentum is not conserved in this case . also , we studied the density probability of pair production in the cases @xmath60 and @xmath23 . our graphical representations show that the functions which define the probabilities of pair production are convergent . from our study we found that the pair production of scalar particles form vacuum , in the presence of an external electric field could take place only when the expansion factor was larger than the mass of the particle . this result proves that the massive scalar particles were produced in early universe . also , in this paper we showed that the probability of pair production vanishes in the minkowski limit . the form of the probability density of scalar particle production helped us to propose a criterion of separation between particles and antiparticles . this criterion is based on the orientation of the momenta of the two particles . we found that the density of probability is maximum when the particles are moving in opposite direction .", "for completing our calculations we use the following integral : @xmath97 in the case of temporal integral we use the relation between hankel function and macdonald function @xcite : @xmath98 the form of the resulted temporal integral is @xcite : @xmath99 in our case @xmath100 and the second condition for convergence is satisfied . also in our case @xmath101 are complex and for solving our integrals we add to @xmath102 a small real part @xmath103 , with @xmath104 and in the end we take the limit @xmath105 . this assure the convergence of our integral and will correctly define the unit step functions and @xmath70 functions . for expressing our amplitude in final form we use the following relation between hypergeometric functions @xcite : @xmath106        this work was supported by the strategic grant posdru/159/1.5/s/137750 , project `` doctoral and postdoctoral programs support for increased competitiveness in exact sciences research '' cofinanced by european social fund within the sectoral operational programme human resources development 2007 -

s@xmath3 steps are wider than s@xmath2 ones . we have observed formation of such defects as faceted pits on these surfaces . in fig .  1 , an initial stage of the defect formation is shown . there observed the local stoppage of growth of an s@xmath3 step and appearance of two s@xmath2 steps instead . in other words , we have observed a gap of the s@xmath3 step . the s@xmath2 steps repulse each other and the defect can not be overgrown quickly . the bottom of the deep pit has a rectangular shape and a long side of it formed by the s@xmath2 step . stm data for the si / si(001 ) surface tilted towards the [ 100 ] direction are presented in fig .  2 . the surface is composed by bent monoatomic steps . in this case every monoatomic step consists of short parts of s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 steps and runs along the [ 100 ] direction . there are local disarrangements of the structure . we suppose this kind of defects to be connected with a process of transition from the mixed s@xmath2+s@xmath3 monoatomic step to two single s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 steps instead of formation of the d@xmath3 step .    we have investigated the structural properties of the si film surface depending on the rate of si deposition . we have found that reduction of the si deposition rate from  0.3 / c ( fig .  2 ) to 0.1 / c ( fig . 3 ) results in appearance of the structure formed by monoatomic steps running along the [ 110 ] direction and formation of shapeless pits on the surface instead of the structure formed by the bent monoatomic steps which run along the [ 100 ] direction .      in figs .  4 and 5 , we present stm data for surfaces of the epilayers deposited at the temperatures of 550 and 470 .    surfaces of the samples grown at 550 consist of s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 monoatomic steps ( fig .  4 ) the mixed s@xmath2+s@xmath3 monoatomic steps which are typical for the si(001 ) surfaces tilted towards [ 100 ] and obtained at higher temperatures are not observed . at this temperature , the transitional mode of the epilayer growth , intermediate between the island growth and the step - flow one , is observed for both tilt directions .    further reduction of the temperature down to 470 results in the island growth mode ( fig .  5 ) . the si / si(001 ) surface is composed by small islands . in both causes such defects as pits are present on the surface . the structural properties of the surfaces of si epilayers grown at the island growth mode do not depend on the direction of the surface tilt .", "summarizing the above we can conclude that processes of generation and growth of surface defects arising during epitaxial growth of si films on si(001 ) vicinal substrates depend on tilt direction of a si(001 ) wafer and the epilayer growth conditions . we suppose the observed effects to be a consequence of mutual interactions of monoatomic steps .    this research has been supported by the ministry of education and science of russian federation through the contracts no . 14.740.11.0069 and 16.513.11.3046 . facilities of center of collective use of scientific equipment of gpi ras were utilized in this research . we appreciate the financial and technological support ."]}

[ e2 ] evaluating the trace over the gamma matrices and adopting the imaginary time formalism at finite temperature , we find ( p ) = -4 g^2 t _ k_0 ( k_0 q_0-*k * ) ( k ) ( q ) , [ e3 ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the sum extends over discrete fermionic energies , @xmath9 . the sum over @xmath10 can easily be performed by introducing the saclay representation of the propagators @xcite ( k ) = -_0 ^ 1/t d e^k_0 \\{[1-n_f(k ) ] e^-k - n_f(k ) e^k } , [ e4 ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the fermi distribution . the calculation of the scalar self energy in the hard thermal loop approximation , @xmath12 , can be done analogously to the gluon polarization tensor @xcite . the only difference between ( [ e3 ] ) and the corresponding expression for the longitudinal part of the gluon self energy by quark polarization is , apart from an overall factor , a different sign between the @xmath13- and @xmath14-term in ( [ e4 ] ) coming from additional gamma matrices due to the quark - gluon vertices in the trace of the gluon polarization tensor . this sign , however , is essential since the minus sign in ( [ e3 ] ) leads to a cancellation of the momentum dependent terms , from which the simple result    \\(p ) = . [ e5 ] follows , whereas in the gluon case a complicated momentum dependent term survives . furthermore the gluon hard thermal loop polarization tensor shows an imaginary part corresponding to landau damping below the light cone . the effective scalar propagator is given by resuming the hard thermal loop self energy ( [ e5 ] ) within a dyson - schwinger equation resulting in ^(k ) = , [ e6 ] where @xmath15 describes an effective thermal mass of the scalar particle generated by the interaction with the fermions of the heat bath . the hard thermal loop fermion self energy caused by the diagram of fig.2 differs from the quark self energy @xcite only by a factor 8/3 . thus we simply may replace the effective quark mass @xmath16 by the effective yukawa fermion mass @xmath17 . the effective fermion propagator in the helicity eigenstate representation is given by @xcite s^(p ) = ( _ 0 - ) + ( _ 0 + ) , [ e7 ] where d_(p ) = -p_0p+ ( 1- ) . [ e8 ] in contrast to the effective scalar propagator ( [ e6 ] ) the effective fermion propagator ( [ e7 ] ) shows an imaginary part giving rise to damping effects , as we will see below . the yukawa theory ( [ e1 ] ) contains no effective vertices on the hard thermal loop level . consider for instance the correction to the three - point vertex shown in fig.3 . according to the rules of power counting @xcite this correction is suppressed compared to the bare vertex by a factor of @xmath5 even if all external legs are soft . the reason for this is the fact that the scalar propagator in fig.3 is cancelled by a factor @xmath18 coming from the fermion propagators in the hard thermal loop limit . in qcd there is an additional gamma matrix in the vertex correction , @xmath19 . owing to the first term the cancellation of the gluon propagator is upset @xcite . similar considerations apply to higher n - point functions . the absence of effective vertices is not surprising as there are no ward identities in the yukawa theory , which relate effective propagators to effective vertices .", "now we turn to the damping of a yukawa fermion . first we consider the damping of a hard fermion with momentum of the order of @xmath2 or larger . comparing with the quark damping rate the lowest order contribution proportional to @xmath0 @xcite should come from the imaginary part of the fermion self energy containing an effective scalar propagator ( fig.4 ) . however , since the scalar propagator has no imaginary part ( virtual landau damping ) the diagram of fig.4 is real . the fermion self energy diagram containing an effective fermion propagator , but a bare scalar propagator due to energy momentum conservation at the vertex , contributes to higher order @xmath20 , as can be seen from the similar case of photon damping @xcite . thus there is no damping of a hard fermion to order @xmath21 in the yukawa theory . the damping rate of a soft yukawa fermion follows from the diagram of fig.5 , where we have to use an effective scalar as well as fermion propagator , since the external momentum is soft , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . the corresponding self energy diagrams for soft quark or gluon damping are much more involved @xcite due to the presence of effective momentum dependent vertices and the momentum dependence of the effective gluon propagator . the damping mechanism corresponding to the fermion self energy of fig.5 can be seen by cutting the diagram @xcite . since the fermion propagator has an imaginary part there is a cut - pole contribution describing `` compton scattering '' . the damping rates of a soft fermion and a plasmino , corresponding to a negative helicity eigenstate , at rest , @xmath24 , are equal and given by @xcite _ ( 0 ) = - tr [ _ 0 i m ^(m_y+i , 0 ) ] , [ e9 ] where @xmath25 is given by fig.5 . substituting the effective scalar and fermion propagators ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) into @xmath26 and evaluating the trace over the gamma matrices yields tr [ _ 0 ^(p ) ] = -2 g^2 t _ k_0 ^(k ) , [ e10 ] where @xmath7 . the sum over the matsubara frequencies can be performed easily by using the saclay method again . in the case of the effective scalar propagator the saclay representation reads ^(k ) = -_0 ^ 1/t d e^k_0 \\ { [ 1+n_b(_k ) ] e^-_k + n_b(_k ) e^_k } , [ e11 ] where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the bose distribution and @xmath28 . in the case of the effective fermion propagator it is convenient to introduce the spectral representation @xcite = -_0 ^ 1/t d e^q_0 _ -^d _ ( , q ) [ 1-n_f ( ) ] e^- , [ e12 ] where the spectral functions @xmath29 are given in ref.@xcite . since the damping comes from the cut term of the fermion propagator we only need the discontinuous part of the spectral function defined by _ ^disc ( x , y ) = i m ( y^2-x^2 ) . [ e13 ] carrying out the sum over @xmath10 and the integrations over @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( [ e10 ] ) reduces to tr [ _ 0 ^(p ) ] & = & g^2 _ -^d [ _ + ^disc(,q ) + _ -^disc(,q ) ] + & & \\ { [ 1-n_f()+n_b(_k ) ] + [ n_f()+n_b(_k ) ] } . [ e14 ] putting the self energy @xmath26 on the mass shell , @xmath32 , @xmath24 , extracting the imaginary part via i m = - ( m_y_k- ) , [ e15 ] and expanding the distribution functions for soft energies , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we obtain after integrating over the angles and @xmath35 the leading term of the damping rate _ ( 0 ) = _ 0^dk [ _ + ^disc(_+,k)+_+^disc(_-,k ) + _ -^disc(_+,k)+_-^disc(_-,k ) ] , [ e16 ] where @xmath36 .    inserting ( [ e13 ] ) into this expression , the step function of the discontinuous part of the spectral function can not be satisfied for @xmath37 which is always larger than @xmath38 . in the case of @xmath39 the step function restricts @xmath38 to k= g t . [ e17 ] carrying out the remaining integration over @xmath38 numerically , we end up with the final result _ ( 0 ) = 0.24 .", "we have considered the yukawa theory at finite temperature . first we have extracted the hard thermal loops and constructed effective green s functions from them . in contrast to gauge theories the boson propagator shows no momentum dependence and is real for all values of the momentum and the energy . also there are no effective vertices in this theory . next we have calculated the damping rate of a yukawa fermion . owing to the absence of an imaginary part of the effective scalar propagator the damping rate of a hard fermion is at least of the order @xmath20 . the damping rate of a soft fermion , on the other hand , is of the order @xmath21 due to the simultaneous use of an effective scalar and fermion propagator . as a new feature , not observed in the case of quarks or gluons , the damping rate of a yukawa fermion at rest contains a kinematic restriction depending on the effective thermal masses of the scalar field and the yukawa fermion . the computation of the yukawa fermion damping rate at rest provides the most simple example for a soft rate using the braaten - pisarski method since no effective vertices are involved and the effective scalar propagator is momentum independent ."]}

user interference channel , i.e. , @xmath39 .    three - user interference channel with delayed csit can achieve total @xmath40 dof by ergodic ia . the proposed ergodic ia is carried out over two phases :    _ transmission phase 1 _ : transmission phase 1 for data transmission is continued until @xmath24 . at each time until @xmath24 , new messages are continuously transmitted . for the time @xmath23 and @xmath41 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the received signals are given by @xmath42 due to delayed csit , the transmitters can not recognize what the current channel states are so that they can not send the same message of @xmath23 at @xmath24 as in the conventional ergodic ia . thus , they just send independent messages at @xmath23 and @xmath24 . after the channel changes , the transmitters can figure out that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at the previous time @xmath24 due to delayed csi feedback . then , transmission phase 2 is entered . _ transmission phase 2 _ : if the previous time was @xmath24 , the transmitters send the following signals at time @xmath43 , respectively : @xmath44 after transmission phase 2 is completed , the transmission mode goes back to transmission phase 1 . each receiver adds its received signals at @xmath23 and @xmath24 and constructs the following variables . @xmath45    _ decoding at receiver 1 _ : using the received signal at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , receiver 1 removes the interfering signals from the other senders in ( [ eq : rx1 ] ) . then , we have an equation for @xmath48 . using another equation for @xmath49 received at @xmath50 , receiver 1 can decode both @xmath51 and @xmath52 . _ decoding at receiver 2 _ : similarly , receiver 2 removes the interfering signals in ( [ eq : rx2 ] ) using the received signal at @xmath50 and @xmath47 and decodes @xmath53 and @xmath54 using the received signal at @xmath46 and ( [ eq : rx2 ] ) .    _ decoding at receiver 3 _ : similarly , receiver 2 removes the interfering signals in ( [ eq : rx3 ] ) using the received signal at @xmath50 and @xmath46 and decodes @xmath55 and @xmath56 using the received signal at @xmath47 and ( [ eq : rx3 ] ) .    according to the decoding procedure , the proposed scheme enables each receiver to decode its 2 messages in 5 symbol times . that is , total 6 messages are decodable over 5 symbol times and hence total 6/5 dof is achievable . total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel with delayed csit by ergodic ia .    for a @xmath0-user interference channel , two independent messages sent at time @xmath23 and @xmath24 are decoded at each receiver over @xmath57 symbol times . as in the three - user interference channel , the time @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to transmission phase 1 . if the transmitters realize the channel matrix at time @xmath24 satisfies the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) , transmission phase 2 starts . then , transmitter @xmath33 , @xmath58 , sends the signal @xmath59 at time @xmath60 . similarly to the three - user interference channel , each receiver can decode its two messages over @xmath57 symbol times . therefore , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia . [ fig : p1 ] shows the achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia ( solid line ) and the retrospective ia @xcite ( dashed line ) with delay csit according to the number of users in a @xmath0-user interference channel . the total achievable dof by the retrospective ia is @xmath61 . it starts from @xmath62 for a three - user case and converges to @xmath63 as @xmath0 goes to infinity . on the other hand , the total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia starts from @xmath40 and converges to @xmath64 . if the receivers feed the time indices at which the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , total achievable dof is the same as the case that delay csit is used . total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia with delay time index feedback in a @xmath0-user interference channel is @xmath8 . the strategy in section [ kudcsit ] can be applied . instead of using the channel state information ( i.e. , channel matrix ) to find the time @xmath23 and @xmath24 at which the condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the receivers send the time indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 since receivers can find them by the assumption of full csir . after receiving the time indices , the transmitters realize that the previous time was @xmath24 and enter into transmission phase 2 .", "in this section , we assume full csir and delayed output feedback . the received signals themselves are fed back to the transmitters . each transmitter can not use the channel information but can use only the delayed received output feedback . it is also assumed that the receivers can reform the output signals and feed them back to the transmitters if necessary . our new proposed strategy is first applied to a three - user interference channel for better explanation of the proposed idea . total @xmath40 dof is achievable by the proposed ergodic ia in a three - user interference channel when only delayed output feedback information is available . the operation of the proposed ergodic ia is classified into two phases :    _ transmission phase 1 _ : the transmission phase 1 for data transmission is continued until @xmath24 . at each time until @xmath24 , new messages are continuously transmitted . for the time @xmath23 and @xmath41 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied , the received signals are given by ( [ rs1 ] ) and ( [ rs2 ] ) . similarly to the case of delayed cit in section iii , the transmitters can not send the same message at @xmath23 and @xmath24 because they can not realize that @xmath24 is the time instant at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied due to the absence of csit . therefore , the transmitters continue to send independent messages at @xmath24 . however , the receivers know that the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied at @xmath24 owing to full csir so that they construct the following output feedback information and send them back to the transmitters after receiving the signals at @xmath24 . @xmath65 then , the transmitters can figure out that the previous time @xmath24 was the time instant at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied after receiving the delayed output feedback information . however , note that they do not know the time instant @xmath23 as well as the message sent at @xmath23 . once after receiving the delayed output feedback information , transmission phase 2 is entered . _ transmission phase 2 _ : after the output feedback signals are received , the transmitters send their signals at time @xmath43 , respectively : @xmath66 after transmission phase 2 is completed , the transmission mode goes back to transmission phase 1 . _ decoding at receiver 1 _ : linearly combining the received signals at @xmath50 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , receiver 1 can obtain the values of @xmath49 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by substituting the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 to @xmath69 , the value of @xmath48 can also be obtained . then , receiver 1 can decode both @xmath51 and @xmath52 because it has two independent equations on @xmath51 and @xmath52  one is given in terms of @xmath49 and the other is given in terms of @xmath48 . _ decoding at receiver 2 _ : similarly , receiver 2 can decode @xmath53 and @xmath54 using linear combination and substitution . _ decoding at receiver 3 _ : similarly , receiver 3 can decode @xmath55 and @xmath56 using linear combination and substitution .    in this way , all 6 messages are decoded in 5 symbol times so that total 6/5 dof is achievable by the proposed ergodic ia .      when only delayed output feedback information is available at the transmitters , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia    for a @xmath0-user interference channel , two independent messages sent at time @xmath23 and @xmath24 are decoded at each receiver over @xmath57 symbol times , where the time time @xmath23 and @xmath24 correspond to transmission phase 1 . after the receivers receive the signals at @xmath24 , receiver @xmath33 , @xmath58 , feed the output @xmath70 back to its own transmitter . after the output feedback signals are received , the transmitters realize that the previous time instant was @xmath24 at which the channel condition in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : channel2 ] ) is satisfied and enters into transmission phase 2 . in transmission phase 2 , transmitter @xmath33 sends the signal @xmath71 at only time @xmath60 . as in the three - user interference channel , each receiver decode its two messages over @xmath57 symbol times . therefore , total @xmath8 dof is achievable in a @xmath0-user interference channel by the proposed ergodic ia . [ fig : p2 ] shows total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia ( solid line ) and the retrospective ia @xcite ( dashed line ) with delayed output feedback without csit according to the number of users . the total achievable dof of the retrospective ia is @xmath72 . it starts from @xmath40 for the three - user case and converges to @xmath63 as @xmath0 goes to infinity . on the other hand , the total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia starts from @xmath40 and approaches to @xmath64 as @xmath0 goes to infinity .", "in this paper , we proposed new ergodic ia techniques in @xmath0-user interference channels with delayed feedback . total achievable dof by the proposed ergodic ia is derived for two scenarios of delayed feedback  delayed channel information and delayed output feedback information . we showed that total @xmath1 dof is achievable by the proposed schemes for both scenarios . the proposed ergodic ia schemes achieve higher dof than the retrospective ia when the feedback information is outdated . v.  s.  annapureddy and v.  v.  veeravalli , `` gaussian interference networks : sum capacity in the low - interference regime and new outer bounds on the capacity region , '' _ ieee trans . inform . theory _ , 55 , no . 7 , pp . 3032 - 3050 , jul . m. costa and a. gamal ,  the capacity region of the discrete memoryless interference channel with strong interference , \" _ ieee trans . info . theory _ , 33 , no . 5 , pp.710 - 711 , sept . r.  h.  etkin , d.  n.  c.  tse and h.  wang , `` gaussian interference channel capacity to within one bit , '' _ ieee trans . info . theory _ , 5534 - 5562 , dec . 2008 . a.  host - madsen and a.  nosratinia , `` the multiplexing gain of wireless networks , '' in _ proc . info . theory _ , adelaide , sa , sep . 2005 , pp . 2065 - 2069 .        c.  huang , s.  a.  jafar , s.  shamai and s.  vishwanath , `` on degrees of freedom region of mimo networks without channel state information at transmitters , '' _ ieee trans . info . theory 849 - 857 , feb . 2012 .        l.  maggi and l.  cottatellucci , `` retrospective interference alignment for interefence channels with delayed feedback , '' in _ proc . ieee wireless communications and networking conference ( wcnc ) _ , paris , france , apr . 2012 ."]}

diquark model @xcite is one of the most successful qcd inspired models to investigate various aspects of hardonic properties where the nucleon is considered to be a bound state of a single quark and a scalar or vector diquark state . recently , a light - front scalar quark - diquark model for the nucleons inspired by soft - wall ads / qcd has been proposed @xcite and extensively used to investigate and reproduce many interesting properties of the nucleons @xcite . the light - front wave functions ( lfwfs ) in this model are obtained by matching the electromagnetic form factors of the hadrons in the soft - wall model of ads / qcd which has been successful in explaining various hadronic properties , for example , hadron mass spectrum , parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , meson and nucleon form factors , transverse densities , structure functions etc . @xcite . the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between the string theories of gravity in the ads space and conformal gauge field theories in the physical space - time provides a completely new set of tool for studying the dynamics of qcd . one can represent the strong interactions of quarks and gluons by a semi - classical gravity theory i.e. , without quantum effects such as particle creation and annihilation in higher dimensions . even though , a perfect string theory dual of qcd is not yet known , the ads / cft correspondence can still provide remarkable insight into various properties / features of qcd including color confinement , qualitative explanation for meson and baryon spectra and wave functions describing the hadron structure . qcd is conformal in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region , whereas , in the infrared ( ir ) region , the confining gauge theory with a mass gap is characterized by the scale @xmath2 and a well defined spectrum of hadronic states . light - front holography represents a remarkable connection between the ads space and the light - front framework where the wave amplitude propagating in the ads space is mapped into the light - front wave functions of hadrons in space - time in terms of a light - front transverse variable @xmath3 ( giving the separation of the quarks and gluonic constituents within the hadron ) @xcite . the electromagnetic form factors , probed through elastic scattering , contain information about the internal structure of the nucleons . a fourier transformation of these form factors provides information about the spatial distributions of charge . the well known examples include the charge and magnetization distributions inside the nucleons . one can obtain the dirac ( charge ) and pauli ( magnetic ) form factors from the overlap of the lfwfs by calculating the matrix element of electromagnetic current @xmath4 in the light - front frame @xcite . in such a frame , the momentum transfer is the conjugate variable of the impact - parameter and via fourier transform with respect to the momentum transfer in transverse direction , the form factors reflect the charge distributions of quarks in the impact - parameter space @xcite . the charge distributions in the transverse coordinate space obtained form the overlap of lfwfs in coordinate space have been studied @xcite and a comparison of charge distributions in transverse impact - parameter space in different ads / qcd models has been reported in refs . @xcite . the gravitational form factors related to the energy momentum tensor @xmath5 also play an important role in the understanding of hadronic physics . they have been studied in both the light - cone and the ads / qcd framework and can also be obtained from the second moments of gpds @xcite . the gravitational form factors @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be obtained from helicity non - flip and helicity flip matrix elements of the @xmath8 tensor current similar to the dirac @xmath9 and pauli @xmath10 form factors respectively . the transverse spin sum rule and gravitational form factors have been studied @xcite . the fourier transform of the gravitational form factor @xmath6 in the impact - parameter space has an interesting interpretation @xcite as it gives the longitudinal momentum density ( @xmath11 density ) in the transverse impact - parameter space . a comparative study of longitudinal momentum densities in transverse impact - parameter space in two different soft - wall ads / qcd models has been carried out @xcite . similar to charge distribution in transverse coordinate space @xcite , it would be interesting to investigate the longitudinal momentum distribution in the transverse coordinate space in the ads / qcd framework .    in the present work , we study the charge as well as the longitudinal momentum distributions in the transverse coordinate space in a light - front quark - diquark model inspired by soft - wall ads / qcd . we take the phenomenological light - front quark - diquark model proposed by gutsche _ et . al _ @xcite with the parameters given in ref . @xcite . in this model , the lfwfs for the proton are constructed from the two particle wave functions obtained in soft - wall ads / qcd @xcite . the parameters in this model are fixed by fitting to the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons . to obtain the charge distribution in coordinate space , we have taken the fourier transform of lfwfs in momentum space . these wave functions have been used to obtain the charge distribution in coordinate space . using the charge and isospin symmetry , we have also calculated the charge distributions for proton and neutron . we have also presented the result for longitudinal momentum distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks . we have considered the different struck quarks to obtain longitudinal momentum distributions . explicit results of the fermionic and bosonic contributions for longitudinal momentum distributions in coordinate space have been presented . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , a brief introduction about the nucleons lfwfs of a quark - diquark model in ads / qcd is given . we discuss the charge distributions in transverse coordinate space for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks as well as the nucleons in section [ charge_coordinate ] . in section [ charge - density ] , we present the relation between the charge distributions in transverse coordinate space and the impact - parameter space . the results of longitudinal momentum distributions in transverse coordinate space for proton and the quarks and diquarks contributions to the distributions for different struck quarks @xmath0 and @xmath1 are presented in section [ longi_coordinate ] . finally , we summarize our work in section [ summary ] .", "here we consider a light - front quark - diquark model for the nucleons @xcite where the lfwfs are modeled from the soft - wall ads / qcd solution . in this model , one can contemplate the three valence quarks of the nucleons as an effectively composite system composed of a fermion ( quark ) and a composite state of diquark ( boson ) based on one loop quantum fluctuations . the dirac and pauli form factors for quarks in this model can be evaluated in terms of overlap of the lfwfs @xcite as [ dirac_ff ] f_1^q(q^2 ) & = & _ 0 ^ 1dx  , + f_2^q(q^2 ) & = & -_0 ^ 1dx   , with @xmath12 for the struck quark . here @xmath13 is the light -

wall model @xcite . all the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 with the constants @xmath31 are determined by fitting the electromagnetic properties of the nucleons : @xmath32 and @xmath33 where the number of valence @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are @xmath34 and @xmath35 in proton and the anomalous magnetic moments for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks are @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . one can write the flavor decompositions of the dirac and pauli form factors of nucleons in a straightforward manner as [ n_ff ] f_i^p(n)=e_u f_i^u(d)+e_d f_i^d(u ) ,  ( i=1,2 ) where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the charges of @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks in units of positron charge ( @xmath40 ) . the nucleon form factors as well as the flavor form factors in this model have already been calculated in ref . @xcite and are found to agree very well with the experimental data .", "in order to evaluate the charge density in coordinate space , the lfwfs in the transverse coordinate space @xmath41 can be obtained by taking the fourier transform of the lfwfs in the momentum space @xmath42 , as ( x , * r*_)= e^i * k*_*r * _ ( x , * k * _ ) . the charge distribution in transverse coordinate space for a particular flavor in the quark -

parameter plane in the light - front quark - diquark model in ads / qcd has been investigated in @xcite but in the present work we extend the calculations to study the longitudinal momentum distribution in transverse coordinate space . in fig.[plot5 ] , we show the longitudinal momentum distributions in transverse coordinate space in the light -

off of quarks distributions ( fig.[plot6](a ) and fig.[plot6](b ) ) at large @xmath13 are slower than the diquark distributions ( fig.[plot6](c ) and fig.[plot6](d ) ) . the magnitudes of the diquark distributions are quite large compared to quark distributions . thus , the peak of the total ( quark + diquark ) distributions effectively appears at lower @xmath13 but the fall -

parameter space . a relation between the distributions in transverse coordinate space and the impact - parameter plane has been shown . it has been found that the charge distributions in coordinate plane are more widely spread compared to the impact - parameter distributions . this phenomena can be clearly understood from the relation between these two different distributions which implies that the @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath61 in @xmath85 . the distributions @xmath62 for the quarks and the nucleons have the peak at lower @xmath13 values and gradually decrease in magnitude with increasing @xmath13 . the distribution for neutron is mostly negative but it has also a small positive distribution which suggests that the central charge density is negative covered by a positively charged shell .    we have also studied the longitudinal momentum distributions for proton and the individual distribution for quark ( fermionic ) and diquark ( bosonic ) in the transverse coordinate space from the gravitational form factors . it has been observed that the diquark distributions are larger than the quark distributions but when the quark and diquark contributions are added up , they provide more or less same proton distributions for different struck @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks . @xmath77 for quarks has the peak near the middle value of @xmath13 but for diquark the peak is at lower @xmath13 value . the diquark distributions fall faster than the quark distributions at large @xmath13 . since @xmath77 for diquarks are large compared to that for quarks , the proton distributions have the peak at small @xmath13 . the distributions however fall slower than the diquark distributions .", "if we have any two functions , @xmath86 and @xmath87 such that f(*k*_)= e^ -i*k * _ ( * r * _ ) , g(*k*_)= e^-i*k * _ ( * r * _ ) , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the fourier transform of @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . then the form factor which can be written as g(*q * _ ) f^*(*k*_-a*q*_)g(*k * _ ) , becomes diagonal in fourier space and we have   e^i*q * _ g(*q * _ ) = 1|a|^2  ^*(*b*_a ) ( * b*_a ) . petrov , p. v. pobylitsa , m. v. polyakov , i. b@xmath90rnig , k. goeke , and c. weiss , phys . d * 57 * , 4325 ( 1998 ) . m. penttinen , m. v. polyakov , and k. goeke , phys . d * 62 * , 014024 ( 2000 ) . a. chodos , r. l. jaffe , k. johnson , c. b. thorn , and v. f. weisskopf , phys . rev . d * 9 * , 3471 ( 1974 ) . x. ji , w. melnitchouk , and x. song , phys . d * 56 * , 5511 ( 2000 ) . t. gutsche , v. e. lyubovitskij , i. schmidt , and a. vega , phys . d * 91 * , 054028 ( 2015 ) . t.  gutsche , v.  e.  lyubovitskij , i.  schmidt , and a.  vega , phys . d * 89 * , 054033 ( 2014 ) . d.  chakrabarti and c.  mondal , phys .  rev . * d 92 * , 074012 ( 2015 ) . a. vega , i. schimdt , t. gutsche , and v. e. lyubovitskij , phys . rev . * d 83 * , 036001 ( 2011 ) ; phys . d * 85 * , 096004 ( 2012 ) ; t. gutsche , v. e. lyubovitskij , i. schmidt , and a. vega , phys . rev . d * 86 * , 036007 ( 2012 ) . a. vega , i schmidt , t. branz , t. gutsche , and v. e. lyubovitskij , phys . rev . d * 80 * , 055014 ( 2009 ) ; t. branz , t. gutsche , v. e. lyubovitskij , i. schmidt , and a. vega , phys . rev . d * 82 * , 074022 ( 2010 ) ; t. gutsche , v. e. lyubovitskij , i. schmidt , and a. vega , phys . rev . d * 85 * , 076003 ( 2012 ) ; phys . d * 87 * , 056001 ( 2013 ) ; phys . d * 90 * , 096007 ( 2014 ) . j. m. maldacena , adv . * 2 * , 231 ( 1998 ) ; int . . phys . * 38 * , 1113 ( 1999 ) . s. j. brodsky and g. f. de teramond , phys . b * 582 * , 211 ( 2004 ) . s. j. brodsky and g. f. de teramond , phys . 96 * , 201601 ( 2006 ) , phys . d * 77 * , 056007 ( 2006 ) . s. j. brodsky and d. s. hwang , nucl . b * 543 * , 239 ( 1999 ) ; s. j. brodsky , d. s. hwang , b. -q . ma , and i. schmidt , nucl . phys . b * 593 * , 311 ( 2001 ) ; s. j. brodsky , m. diehl , and d. s. hwang , nucl . b * 596 * , 99 ( 2001 ) . m. burkardt , phys . rev d. * 62 * , 071503 ( 2000 ) , int . a * 18 * , 173 ( 2003 ) . g. a. miller , phys . c * 80 * , 045201 ( 2009 ) . g. a. miler , annu . rev sci . * 60 * , 1 ( 2010 ) . s. venkat , j. arrington , g. a. miller , and x. zhan , phys . rev . c * 83 * , 015203 ( 2011 ) . d. muller _ et al . _ , fortschr . phys . * 42 * , 101 ( 1994 ) ; x. ji , phys . lett . * 78 * , 610 ( 1997 ) ; a.  v. radyushkin , phys . d * 56 * , 5524 ( 1997 ) . x. ji , w. melnithouk , and x. song , phys . d * 56 * , 5511 ( 1997 ) ."]}
{"section_names": ["introduction", "theoretical formulation", "results:", "conclusion:"], "sections": ["current days biomolecules are receiving huge attention from different scientific communities including physics , chemistry and others because of their possible applications in nanoelctronics and the need of understanding electronic ( spin ) transfer process in biological systems  @xcite . dna is one of them which has attracted major attention from the beginning of the last decade  @xcite . whereas other biomolecules such as proteins are less attended in this respect . however with the recent progress in chiral - induced spin selectivity ( ciss ) both dna and protein are getting similar attraction  @xcite across various disciplines as they both have helical structures which can be used for efficient spin polarization . in 2011 et al_.  @xcite showed that double - stranded dna ( ds - dna ) can be used as a good spin filtering agent with length dependent spin polarization up to 60@xmath0 . whereas no spin polarization was achieved for single - stranded dna ( ss - dna ) . these findings are then theoretically supported by guo _ et al_.  @xcite . but recent experiments suggest that @xmath1-helical proteins are also quite efficient in spin polarization process though it has single helical structure  @xcite . these results open up an opportunity to examine these single - helical structures from a new aspect , different models are also proposed to explain these experimental results  @xcite . in respect of electronic transport properties dna is widely studied , though there are still controversies over different experimental results  @xcite . questions are still remain on reproducibility of the experimental data and underlying charge transfer mechanism  @xcite . whereas the same properties of different protein molecules are less examined . there are few number of reports available in literature on the electronic transfer process in proteins  @xcite but no such report on the effects of environment on its electronic transport properties . it is confirmed by ciss study and related theoretical work that there are multiple charge conduction pathways ( mccp ) present in single - helical proteins due to which they are able to polarize the electron spin  @xcite . this possibility of mccp make helical protein molecules very good agents for long - range charge transport . as proteins have these mccp , electrons will face less disturbances / environmental effects during conduction and transport characteristics will be much rigid ; reproducing experimental results will be much simpler with them . in this paper we make an attempt to study the electronic transport properties of single helical proteins incorporating both the helical symmetry and possibility of mccp within tight - binding framework . we propose a model hamiltonian to explore electronic transport through single - helical proteins and compare our results with another model proposed in ref . we study different transport properties from localization behaviour to i - v response including the effects of environment that are modeled in terms of disordered on - site potential of the amino acids within the tight - binding hamiltonian . our investigations show that due to presence of mccp the effects of environment are much smaller which enable long range coherent charge transfer in these biomolecules . interplay of helical symmetry and disorder also has non - trivial effects on localization and i - v responses of the protein molecules .", "the two - terminal electronic transport through single - helical protein molecule can be simulated using the following tight - binding hamiltonian for the entire system    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian for the protein molecule , @xmath4 represents the one dimensional semi - infinite leads on the both sides of the protein molecule and @xmath5 is the tunneling hamiltonian between protein molecule and the leads . the hamiltonian  ( fig.[fig1 ] ) for the protein molecule is formed on the basis set spanned by the amino acids @xmath6    where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons at the _ i_th wannier state of the protein molecule with length n , @xmath9 nearest neighbour hopping amplitude , @xmath10 on - site potential energy of the amino acids , @xmath11= hopping integral between two neighboring atomic sites in adjacent pitches which incorporates the possibility of mccp along the helix . here @xmath12 is the number of amino acids within a given pitch , parameter that accounts for the helical symmetry . a dispersion relation for an infinite homogeneous chain of protein molecule can be obtained following the above hamiltonian : @xmath13 which explicitly depends on helical symmetry ( @xmath12 ) .    ) between neighbouring amino acids of adjacent pitches . the red line shows the single helix.,width=64,height=283 ]    apart from the above model , we also use another model following ref . @xcite to compare our results . the protein molecule is described in this model following the tight - binding hamiltonian ( later on we refer this as model:2 throughout the paper )    @xmath14    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath15 and n have their usual meanings . @xmath17 is the jth neighbouring hopping amplitude , where @xmath18 is the distance between to neighbour @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the decay exponent and @xmath22 is the nearest neighbour hopping integral . here we have assumed that wave functions related to electrons decay exponentially over distance . these assumptions are similar to the slater - koster scheme , and @xmath21 can be obtained by matching to first - principle calculations  @xcite .    in order to study the transport behavior of protein molecules , we use semi - infinite 1d chains as leads connected to the left ( l ) and right ( r ) ends of the protein molecule and the corresponding hamiltonian can be expressed as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively represent left and right semi - infinite 1d leads . the tunneling hamiltonian between the leads and protein molecule is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the tunneling matrix element between protein and the leads . in order to obtain transmission probability @xmath28 of electron through single - helical protein we use the green s function formalism  @xcite . the single particle retarded green s function for the entire system at an energy @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . the transmission probability of an electron with incident energy @xmath29 is given by @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath33 represents trace over reduced hilbert space spanned by the protein molecule . the retarded and the advanced green s functions in the reduced hilbert space can be expressed as @xmath34^\\dagger=[e- h_{pro}-\\sigma^r_l-\\sigma^r_r+i\\eta]^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath35 is retarded ( advanced ) self energy of the left ( right ) lead and @xmath36 $ ] is the level broadening due to coupling of the leads with the protein molecule . @xmath37 being the retarded ( advanced ) green s function for the left ( right ) lead . it can easily be shown that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 represents the imaginary part . at absolute zero temperature , using the landauer formula , current through the protein molecule for an applied bias voltage @xmath40 is given by @xmath41  , where @xmath42 is the fermi energy . we have assumed that voltage drop occurs only at the boundaries of the conductor .", "to perform numerical study we use following parameter values for our proposed model throughout the entire work : @xmath15=0 ev , @xmath43=1.0 ev and @xmath11=@xmath43/10=0.1 ev . we compare our results with model:2 using the following parameters : @xmath44=4.1 , @xmath45=5.8 , @xmath46=5.1 , @xmath47=6.2 , @xmath48=8.9 , @xmath49=10.0 and @xmath21 is taken as 0.9 , all units are in  . using these values we can calculate the related hopping integrals ( @xmath16 ) which gives @xmath50 @xmath51 0.16@xmath22 and so on . it is clear that gradually @xmath16 values will decrease ( except @xmath52 ) with increasing distance , therefore we restrict ourselves to @xmath53 and set @xmath22=@xmath43=1.0 ev . these parameter values for model:2 are extracted from ref . for ss - dna , to calculate its transport properties , we set @xmath11=0 ev in our model which cancels any possibility of mccp . we first study the localization properties of the system . the localization length ( @xmath54 ) of the system is calculated from the lyapunov exponent ( @xmath55 )  @xcite    @xmath56    where @xmath57 = length of the system and @xmath58 denotes average over different disorder configurations . in actual experiments there are various environmental fluctuations that we have simulated in the model by considering the on - site energy @xmath15 to be randomly distributed within the range [ @xmath15-w/2 , @xmath15+w/2 ] , where w represents the disorder strength .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in fig . [ fig4 ] we show the i - v characteristics of the protein molecule using our proposed model for @xmath12=3 and 5 . it is clear from the plots that for low disorder , current is almost linear and with increasing disorder ( w=5 ) system becomes insulating . one difference is to be noted between @xmath12=3 and 5 , current output is always greater for @xmath12=5 than @xmath12=3 . this difference becomes more distinguishable under environmental fluctuations . if we increase @xmath12 , electrons get more number of pathways to hop from one site to another . in other words , increasing @xmath12 provides a shortcut pathway for electrons to move along the helix from one pitch to the next bypassing all other amino acids in that pitch . due to this galloping electrons encounter less scattering , hence the current increases . for @xmath12=5 at w=2 , i - v response is linear at low bias but it saturates with increasing bias voltage which signifies that there are no more accessible states available to conduct electrons at higher bias . for model:2 , at low disorder there is not so much variation in the current response with our model , but for appreciable disorder ( w=2 ) response become semiconducting with cut - off voltage around 0.5 volt , in contrast with linear response achieved in our model . this variation of current is due to the difference in these two models . the model:2 only caters the possibility of multiple charge conduction pathways but neglect the helical symmetry which is a fundamental structure of these biomolecules . our model also incorporates this symmetry , due to which electron transport enhances and current output is always greater in our case ( @xmath12=5 ) . the i - v responses of the protein molecule under environmental effects match qualitatively well with experimental findings  @xcite . for ss - dna current output is quite similar with the protein molecule for clean case ( w=0 ) , but as soon as we apply disorder current decreases rapidly . if we compare ss - dna with protein molecule ( @xmath12=5 ) , one can easily see that even under small disorder ( w=0.5 , 0.8 ) there is substantial drop in the current output for ss - dna . this shows that single - helical proteins are much better conductor under external disturbances than ss - dna .", "we present a detail analysis of electronic transport properties of single - helical protein molecules based on tight - binding framework . though with recent progress in ciss single helical proteins are getting considerable attention these days but their basic electronic transport properties remain quite under - explored . we show that due to existence of both the helical symmetry and mccp transport properties are less affected by external disturbances and these biomolecules can serve as a better alternative in nanoelectronics than its dna counterparts ( ss - dna ) or other artificial semiconductor nanowires which do not contain the possibility of mccp . as a consequence of these features long range coherent electron transport can be possible in these biomolecules and effect of environment will also be lesser . we also show that by varying @xmath12 _ i.e. _ , by twist - stretching of the protein molecules one can get different responses ( current outputs ) under environmental effects . as an example , for @xmath12=5 system is more conducting than @xmath12=3 . we compare our results with the model proposed by guo et al . @xcite , that matches qualitatively well in almost every aspect . but as our model includes both mccp and helical symmetry ( both are actually present in single - helical proteins ) it provides more number of conduction channels and system becomes less localized . due to helical symmetry ( @xmath12 ) the behaviour of localization properties also change which shows that using twist - stretching or conformal changes one can use a protein molecule in different ways . we check our results for other model parameters also _ e.g. _ , @xmath21=0.4 and 1.4   @xcite but the qualitative behaviour remains the same . in summary our study shows the rigidity of transport properties of the single - helical protein molecules even under environmental effects due to presence of both the helical symmetry and mccp , which promises that they can be used in future nanoelectronic devices with much more reliability ."]}

mediated feedback @xcite and quantum - jump - based feedback controls have been proposed to generate steady state entanglement in a cavity @xcite . these two feedback schemes are markovian , namely , a feedback information proportional to the quantum - jump detection is synchronously used . besides , these control scheme can also be used to suppress decoherence @xcite . meanwhile , researchers are looking for proper systems for experimental implementation of quantum information processing . among the various candidates , solid - states quantum devices based on superconductors @xcite and lateral quantum dots @xcite are promising ones , however , the decoherence from intrinsic noise originating from two - level fluctuators is hard to engineered @xcite . for this reason , the nuclear spins have attracted considerable attention @xcite due to its long coherence times @xcite . but their weak interactions to others make the preparation , control , and detection on them difficult . thanks to its intrinsic interactions with electron spins , electron spin can be used as an ancilla to access single nuclear spin . this naturally leads us to rise the following question : can feedback strategy be used to suppress decoherence , prepare and protect entanglement between the nuclear and electron spins by controlling the electron spin ? in this paper , we will study this problem by considering a nuclear spin ( as a qubit ) coupled to electron spin ( as the other qubit ) that is exposed to its environment . we show that a markovian feedback based on quantum - jump can be used to suppress decoherence , produce entanglement and protect it . the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we describe our model and present the dynamics in absence of feedback . in sec.iii , we introduce the quantum -

each component is a knot . a _ string link _ can be defined as follows :    ( habegger and lin @xcite ) let d be the unit disk in the plane and let i = [ 0,1 ] be the unit interval . choose k points @xmath3 in the interior of d , aligned in order along the the x - axis . a * string link * @xmath4 of k components is a smooth proper imbedding of k disjoint copies of i into @xmath5 : @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the image of @xmath9 is called the ith string of the string link @xmath4 .    link and string link invariants are defined in the same way as for knots . note that any string link can be closed up to a link in a unique way by joining the top and bottom of each component by an arc which lies outside of @xmath5 ( and which is unlinked with the other such arcs ) . so any link invariant gives rise to a string link invariant by evaluating it on the closure of the string link . our treatment of finite type invariants will follow the combinatorial approach of birman and lin  @xcite . we will give a brief overview of this combinatorial theory , and its natural extensions to links and string links . for more details , see bar - natan  @xcite . we first note that we can extend any link invariant to an invariant of _ singular _ links , where a singular link is an immersion of a disjoint union of copies of @xmath0 in 3-space which is an embedding except for a finite number of isolated double points . given a link invariant @xmath10 , we extend it via the relation :    @xmath11    an invariant @xmath10 of singular links is then said to be of _ finite type _ , specifically of _ type n _ , if @xmath10 is zero on any link with more than @xmath12 double points ( where @xmath12 is a finite nonnegative integer ) . we denote by @xmath13 the vector space over @xmath14 generated by ( framing - independent ) finite type invariants of type @xmath12 . we can completely understand the space of finite type invariants by understanding all of the vector spaces @xmath15 . an element of this vector space is completely determined by its behavior on links with exactly @xmath12 singular points . in addition , since such an element is zero on links with more than @xmath12 singular points , any other ( non - singular ) crossing of the knot can be changed without affecting the value of the invariant . this means that elements of @xmath15 can be viewed as functionals on the space of _ chord diagrams _ : a * chord diagram of degree n with k components * is a disjoint union of k oriented circles , together with @xmath12 chords ( line segments with endpoints on the circles ) , such that all of the @xmath16 endpoints of the chords are distinct . the circles represent a link of k components and the endpoints of a chord represent 2 points identified by the immersion of this link into 3-space . the diagram is determined by the orders of the endpoints on each component . for string links , chord diagrams involve oriented line segments rather than circles .    functionals on the space of chord diagrams which are derived from finite type link invariants will satisfy certain relations :    a * weight system of degree n * is a linear functional @xmath17 on the space of chord diagrams of degree @xmath12 ( with values in an associative commutative ring @xmath18 with unity ) which satisfies the 1-term and 4-term relations , shown in figure  [ f:4-term ] . for knots , the three arcs all belong to the same circle ; for links ( resp . string links ) , they may belong to the same or different circles ( resp . line segments ) . ( 1-term relation ) @xmath19 ( 4-term relation ) @xmath20    the natural map from elements of @xmath15 to functionals on chord diagrams is a homomorphism into the space of weight systems @xcite . kontsevich proved the much more difficult fact that these spaces are isomorphic @xcite ( the inverse map is the famous _ kontsevich integral _ ) . for convenience , we take the dual approach , and simply study the space of chord diagrams of degree @xmath12 modulo the 1-term and 4-term relations . the 1-term relation is occasionally referred to as the `` framing - independence '' relation , because it arises from the framing - independence of the invariants in @xmath13 ( essentially , from the first reidemeister move ) . since most of the interesting structure of the vector spaces arises from the 4-term relation , it is common to look at the more general setting of invariants of regular isotopy , and consider the vector space @xmath21 of chord diagrams of degree @xmath12 on links with @xmath2 components modulo the 4-term relation alone . linear functionals on @xmath21 are called _ regular weight systems _ of degree @xmath12 . similarly , we define the vector space @xmath22 for chord diagrams of degree @xmath12 on _ string links _ of @xmath2 components . it is useful to combine all of these spaces into graded modules @xmath23 and @xmath24 via direct sum . for @xmath25 , we can define a product on @xmath26 via connect sum @xcite ; however , this does not extend to @xmath27 . but we _ can _ give the module @xmath28 a bialgebra ( or hopf algebra ) structure for any @xmath2 by defining an appropriate product and co - product :    * we define the ( noncommutative ) product @xmath29 of two chord diagrams @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the result of placing @xmath31 on top of @xmath30 ( joining the components so the orientations agree ) , as shown below : @xmath32 * we define the co - product @xmath33 of a chord diagram @xmath34 as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a subset of the set of chords of @xmath34 , @xmath37 is @xmath34 with all the chords in @xmath36 removed , and @xmath38 is @xmath34 with all the chords _ not _ in @xmath36 removed . @xmath39    it is easy to check the compatibility condition @xmath40 .", "for knots , there is a very natural notion of intersection among the chords of a chord diagram - two chords intersect if their endpoints alternate around the bounding circle . the intersection graph then has a vertex for each chord , and connects two vertices by an edge if the corresponding chords intersect . the difficulty with extending this idea to links and string links is how to deal with chords which have their endpoints on different components of the diagram - specifically , if they each have one endpoint on a given component , and their other endpoints are on different components . in what sense , if any , do these chords intersect ? the essential value of the intersection graph for knots is that it can detect when the order of two endpoints for different chords along the bounding circle is switched ( as happens in the 4-term relation ) , since this changes the pair of chords from intersecting to non - intersecting or vice - versa . to usefully extend the notion of intersection graphs to links or string links , we need to retain this ability . for string links , the existence of a `` bottom '' and `` top '' for each component allows us to give a linear ( rather than cyclic ) ordering to the endpoints of the chords on each component , and so the notion of one endpoint being `` below '' another is well - defined . let @xmath34 be a string link chord diagram with @xmath2 components ( oriented line segments , colored from 1 to @xmath2 ) and @xmath12 chords . the _ intersection graph _ @xmath41 is the labeled , directed multigraph such that :    * @xmath41 has a vertex for each chord of @xmath34 . each vertex is labeled by an unordered pair @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the labels of the components on which the endpoints of the chord lie . * there is a directed edge from a vertex @xmath45 to a vertex @xmath46 for each pair @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an endpoint of the chord associated to @xmath45 , @xmath49 is an endpoint of the chord associated to @xmath46 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 lie on the same component of @xmath34 , and the orientation of the component runs from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( so if the components are all oriented upwards , @xmath48 is below @xmath49 ) . we count these edges `` mod 2 '' , meaning that if two vertices are connected by two directed edges with the same direction , they cancel each other . if two vertices are connected by a directed edge in each direction , we will simply connect them by an undirected edge . examples of chord diagrams and their associated intersection graphs are given in figure  [ f : igstring ] . @xmath50    note that when the two chords have both endpoints on the same component @xmath43 , our definition of intersection graph corresponds to the usual intersection graph for knots . our definition also matches our intuition in the case of chord diagrams of two components , as shown in figure  [ f : igstring ] . note also that the total number of directed edges between a vertex @xmath10 labeled @xmath42 and a vertex @xmath51 labeled @xmath52 is given by the sum of the number of occurrences of @xmath43 in @xmath52 and the number of occurrences of @xmath44 in @xmath52 . in particular , if a vertex @xmath10 has a label @xmath53 , this number will be even ( 0 , 2 or 4 ) . since we count directed edges modulo 2 , this implies there is an ( uncancelled ) directed edge from @xmath10 to another vertex @xmath51 if and only if there is also an ( uncancelled ) directed edge from @xmath51 to @xmath10 . we will say that labeled directed multigraphs which have this property are _ [ d : semisym ] a directed multigraph g , with each vertex labeled by a pair \\{i , j } , is * semisymmetric * if for every vertex v labeled \\{i , i } , and any other vertex w , there is a directed edge from v to w if and only if there is a directed edge from w to v.      following lando s work for knots @xcite , we can define a bialgebra structure on the space of intersection graphs for string links so that @xmath54 becomes a bialgebra homomorphism from the space of chord diagrams for string links to the space of intersection graphs . the key is to define the analogue of the 4-term relation for intersection graphs . consider the graded vector space ( over @xmath55 ) of formal linear combinations of labeled semisymmetric directed multigraphs , with vertices labeled by unordered pairs \\{i , j } , @xmath56 , graded by the number of vertices in the graphs . for any graph g and vertices a and b in v(g ) , with labels \\{i , j } and \\{i , l } respectively ( j and l may be equal , or equal to i ) , we impose on the vector space the relation : @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the result of complementing the edge ab in g ( i.e. adding a directed edge between the vertices in each direction , and then cancelling `` mod 2 '' ) . @xmath59 is the result of changing the label on a to \\{j , l } , complementing the edge ab if @xmath60 ( and leaving it unchanged if i = l ) , and adding a directed edge from a to c ( respectivley c to a ) for every vertex c in v(g ) for which g has a directed edge from b to c ( respectively c to b ) , and then cancelling mod 2 . finally , @xmath61 is the result of complementing the edge ab in @xmath59 . here is an example of such a relation : @xmath62 the bialgebra @xmath63 is defined as this graded vector space , together with a product and a coproduct . the product is a map @xmath64 , defined as follows . given graphs @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the disjoint union of the graphs , together with a directed edge from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for each color in the label \\{i , j } for @xmath45 which is also in the label for @xmath46 . an example is shown below : @xmath70 the coproduct is a map @xmath71 , defined as follows . for any graph g , and subset @xmath72 of its vertices , let @xmath73 denote the subgraph induced by @xmath36 . then : @xmath74 an example is shown below : @xmath75    [ t : bialgebra ] the product and coproduct defined above induce the structure of a co - commutative ( but not commutative ) bialgebra on the space f of labeled , directed multigraphs modulo the 4-term relation . proof : it is easy to check that @xmath63 is a bialgebra ( i.e. that @xmath76 ) , and that it is co - commutative , but not commutative . we also need to check that the product and coproduct respect the 4-term relation , i.e. that the product of a graph and a 4-term relation yields a 4-term relation , and that the coproduct of a 4-term relation yields a sum of 4-term relations . to begin with , consider a product @xmath77 . it is clear that @xmath78 , since complementing the edge @xmath79 is independent of any edges between @xmath80 and @xmath81 . moreover , @xmath82 , since in each case there is an directed edge from a vertex @xmath83 to @xmath84 for each occurrence of @xmath44 or @xmath85 in the label of @xmath10 ( with cancellation mod 2 ) . it is then clear that @xmath86 , and so the product of the 4-term relation and another graph is another 4-term relation .    for the coproduct , consider @xmath87 . the sum in the coproduct splits into two groups - terms where both @xmath84 and @xmath88 belong to either @xmath36 or its complement , and terms where one of the two vertices is in @xmath36 and the other is in its complement . the first group gives a sum of 4-term relations , while the terms of the second group already sum to zero in @xmath89 and @xmath90 . this finishes the proof of the theorem . @xmath91 it is now easy to check that @xmath54 is a bialgebra homomorphism from the bialgebra @xmath28 of chord diagrams for string links with @xmath2 components modulo the 4-term relation to the bialgebra @xmath92 of directed , labeled graphs with labels 1 , ... , @xmath2 , since the 4-term relation for graphs was defined to mimic the 4-term relation for the chord diagrams . as a result , any functional on @xmath92 will induce , by composition with @xmath54 , a regular weight system . we call such a functional a _ regular graph weight system_.", "any particular weight system will satisfy relations in addition to the 1-term and 4-term relations , and it can be useful to look at weight systems which lie in the subspaces determined by these additional relations . in particular , bar - natan and garoufalides @xcite noted that the weight system associated with the conway polynomial for knots satisfies a set of _ 2-term _ relations which induce the 4-term relations . we can extend this notion to define a set of 2-term relations for string links , shown in figure  [ f:2-term ] . [ h ] @xmath93    clearly , these relations imply that the weight system satisfies the 4-term relation as well . as a result , the product and coproduct of section [ ss : finitetype ] are still well - defined . so we can give the vector space of chord diagrams for string links with @xmath2 components modulo the 2-term relations the structure of a bialgebra . we will denote this bialgebra ( and the underlying vector space ) by @xmath94 . there is a natural projection from @xmath28 to @xmath94 .    similarly , we can look at the quotient space of @xmath63 by the 2-term relations @xmath95 since @xmath96 , the 2-term relations imply the 4-term relations , and the quotient space is a bialgebra @xmath97 with the product and coproduct induced from @xmath63 . @xmath54 is then a bialgebra homomorphism from @xmath94 to @xmath98 . bar - natan and garoufalides @xcite analyzed the space of chord diagrams for knots ( equivalently , string links of one component ) modulo the 2-term relations . they found that @xmath99 is generated ( as a vector space ) by _ ( @xmath100)-caravans _ of @xmath101 `` one - humped camels '' ( isolated chords which intersect no other chords ) and @xmath102 `` two - humped camels '' ( pairs of chords which intersect each other , but no other chords ) . an example of such a caravan is shown in figure  [ f : caravan ] . [ h ] @xmath103    our goal in this section is to find a similar `` normal form '' for string link chord diagrams with more than one component ; this will be useful in the remainder of the paper . we will prove the following theorem :    [ t : normalform ] any connected string link chord diagram is equivalent , modulo the 2-term relations , to a chord diagram with components numbered 1 , ... , n ( possibly after renumbering ) such that :    * every chord either has both endpoints on component 1 , or endpoints on components i and i+1 for some i. * the chords with both endpoints on component 1 are arranged in a caravan . moreover , all of their endpoints lie below the endpoints of any chords between components . * there are at most 2 chords between components i and i+1 , and if there are 2 they do not cross ( so the endpoints of one chord lie above the endpoints of the other on both components ) . * on component i , the endpoints of chords connecting component i to component i+1 lie below the endpoints of chords connecting component i to component i-1 . an example is shown in figure  [ f : normal ] . [ h ] @xmath104    if a diagram is not connected , we simply put each connected component into normal form . the proof proceeds in several steps . we will describe an algorithm to put any connected chord diagram into the normal form described above via 2-term relations . + step 1 : we first deal with chords which have both endpoints on the same component . to begin with , any pair of intersecting chords which have all four endpoints on the same component can be slid to the bottom of the component , away from any other chords , to form a two - humped camel as in @xcite . an isolated chord with both endpoints on the same component can also be slid down to the bottom , forming a one - humped camel . see figure  [ f : factor ] for examples of these moves . [ h ] @xmath105    we are left with chords with both endpoints on the same component which only intersect chords which lie between two different components . by sliding this chord over one of the chords it intersects , its endpoints are now on two different components , as shown in figure  [ f : step1 ] . [ h ] @xmath106    step 2 : our next step is to put every chord connecting two different components on a different horizontal `` level '' ; in particular , we will remove intersections between chords between the same two components . say that we have @xmath12 chords between components . select a chord arbitrarily , which we will denote chord @xmath107 . without loss of generality , assume @xmath107 connects components 1 and 2 . we will move @xmath107 to the top level . as we move it up , if we come to a chord with an endpoint on components 1 or 2 which is above @xmath107 we move that endpoint below @xmath107 via a 2-term relation , as shown in figure  [ f : step2 ] . [ h ] @xmath108    ultimately , the endpoints of @xmath107 will lie above the endpoints of any other chord . during this process , some chords may have had both their endpoints moved to the same component - remove or modify these chords as in step 1 ( notice that this only reduces the number of chords between components from @xmath12 ) . we are left with _ at most _ @xmath109 chords connecting components , all below @xmath107 . so we can continue the process inductively , ending with all chords between components horizontal , at different levels ( and with a caravan at the bottom of each component ) . + step 3 : now we consider one component of the diagram , say component 1 , and move all the chords with an endpoint on component 1 to a higher level than all the other chords in the diagram ( leaving chords with both endpoints on the same component at the bottom ) . we will denote by an _ ( i , j)-chord _ a chord with endpoints on components @xmath43 and @xmath44 . if a ( 1,@xmath43)-chord lies directly below an ( @xmath110)-chord along component @xmath43 , we can use a 2-term relation to move the ( 1,@xmath43)-chord above the other chord , in the process transforming it into a ( 1,@xmath44)-chord , as in figure  [ f : step3 ] . [ h ] @xmath111    since there are only a finite number of chords , we can successively move all chords with one endpoint on component 1 above all other chords ( while the other endpoint may move , one will always remain on component 1 ) . + step 4 : let @xmath107 be the top chord at this point ; without loss of generality , @xmath107 is a ( 1,2)-chord . let @xmath112 be the number of ( 1,@xmath43)-chords , and @xmath113 . now move @xmath107 down component 1 , stripping other chords off of component 1 by 2-term relations , transforming them from ( 1,@xmath43)-chords to ( 2,@xmath43)-chords , reversing the move from step 2 shown in figure  [ f : step2 ] . continue this until @xmath107 encounters another ( 1,2)-chord , @xmath114 . now move @xmath107 back up as in step 3 ( see figure [ f : step3 ] ) ; when it is again at the top , it will be a ( 1,@xmath43)-chord for some @xmath43 . repeat the process for @xmath114 , moving it up to just below @xmath107 , and with all the other ( 1,2)-chords . this reduces @xmath115 to @xmath116 , though the chords may no longer be ( 1,2)-chords . we can relabel the components so that @xmath107 is once again a ( 1,2)-chord and repeat the process . each repetition reduces @xmath115 , until we reach a point where @xmath117 ( i.e. all chords with an endpoint on component 1 are ( 1,2)-chords ) , and the ( 1,2)-chords lie above all other chords in the diagram . finally , we can reduce @xmath116 to 1 or 2 by noticing that whenever @xmath118 , we can factor out a 2-humped camel and reduce @xmath116 by 2 , as in figure  [ f : reduce ] . +    [ h ] @xmath119    step 5 : we can now repeat steps 3 and 4 for component 2 , and then for each component in turn . we are left with a diagram which is almost in normal form - the final step is to move all of the caravans to component 1 . we can move a caravan from the @xmath43th component to the @xmath120th component by sliding it over a chord between the two components , as in figure  [ f : step5 ] . [ h ] @xmath121    any other chords between the two components can be slid over the caravan in turn by 2-term relations , leaving the caravan below the chords connecting components @xmath122 and @xmath123 . continuing in this way , the caravans can be moved to component 1 , and finally pushed to to bottom of component 1 as in step 1 . this completes the proof of theorem [ t : normalform ] . @xmath91      in this section we will define the adjacency matrix for an intersection graph , and show that its rank and determinant ( over @xmath124 ) are regular graph weight systems .    [ d : adj ] given a directed graph g with n vertices , @xmath125 , such that each vertex @xmath126 has a label @xmath127 , the * adjacency matrix of g * , or adj(g ) , is the @xmath128 matrix defined by : @xmath129 @xmath130    these matrices can be viewed as bilinear forms over @xmath124 , but unlike the case for knots @xcite , they are not generally symmetric , so their classification is much more difficult ( and still , to my knowledge , an open question ) . we are interested in the notion of _ congruence _ of such matrices . we are particularly interested in the adjacency matrices of _ semisymmetric _ graphs ; which have the property ( which we will also denote by semisymmetry ) that if the @xmath43th diagonal element is 0 , then the @xmath43th row and column are the same . we say that two @xmath131 matrices a and b are * congruent * ( denoted @xmath132 ) if there is an invertible matrix p such that @xmath133 . one of our main results is that the congruence class of the adjacency matrix ( over @xmath124 ) satisfies the 2-term relation , and so induces a regular graph weight system .    for any graph g in e , @xmath134 . proof : reordering the vertices of @xmath80 changes @xmath135 by a congruence ; in this case , @xmath136 is the result of doing a corresponding reordering of the rows of the identity matrix . so we can assume that the first two rows and columns of @xmath135 and @xmath137 correspond to the vertices @xmath84 and @xmath88 . the matrices are identical except for the first row and column . say that @xmath84 has label @xmath138 and @xmath88 has label @xmath139 , so in @xmath59 @xmath84 has label @xmath140 . an entry @xmath141 ( where @xmath142 ) is equal to @xmath143 ( mod 2 ) , and similarly for the first column . @xmath144 if and only if @xmath145 , i.e. if @xmath146 , so @xmath147 . finally , @xmath148 if @xmath149 , and 1 otherwise . we have five cases . +   + case 1 : @xmath150 . in this case @xmath151 and @xmath152 ( due to the semisymmetry of the graph ) . so , mod 2 , @xmath153 . +   + case 2 : @xmath154 . in this case @xmath155 and @xmath152 . so , mod 2 , @xmath156 . +   + case 3 : @xmath157 . in this case , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . so , mod 2 , @xmath161 . +   + case 4 : @xmath162 . in this case , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and @xmath160 . so , mod 2 , @xmath161 . +   + case 5 : @xmath165 all different . in this case @xmath155 and @xmath166 . so , mod 2 , @xmath161 . + we conclude that @xmath167 . therefore @xmath135 and @xmath137 are congruent by a matrix @xmath136 , where @xmath136 is the elementary matrix constructed from the identity matrix by adding the second row to the first row . in other words , @xmath136 is the same as the identity , except for the 2 by 2 matrix in the upper left corner , which is @xmath168 $ ] . @xmath91    the congruence class of the adjacency matrix of the intersection graph is invariant under the 4-term relations . the determinant ( mod 2 ) and rank ( over @xmath124 ) of the adjacency matrix of the intersection graph are regular graph weight systems . proof : if @xmath136 is invertible over @xmath124 , the rank of @xmath169 is the same as the rank of @xmath84 . in addition , @xmath170 ( mod 2 ) , so the determinant is also a congruence invariant mod 2 . @xmath91      for knots , the conway and homfly weight systems can be interpreted via intersection graphs @xcite . to what extent can we do the same for string links ? in general , this is still an open problem , but we can offer a few initial results . let us recall the definitions of the conway polynomial and weight system . the conway polynomial @xmath171 of a link is a power series @xmath172 . it can be computed via the skein relation ( where @xmath173 are as in figure  [ f : skein ] ) :    [ b ] @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 we define the conway polynomials of a string link as the conway polynomial of the link formed by closing the string link in the natural way . the coefficient @xmath177 is a finite type invariant of type @xmath12 @xcite , and therefore defines a weight system @xmath178 of degree @xmath12 . the collection of all these weight systems is called the conway weight system , denoted @xmath179 . consider a chord diagram @xmath34 , together with a chord @xmath10 . let @xmath180 be the result of _ surgery on v _ , i.e. replacing @xmath10 by an band which preserves the orientation of the components , and then removing the interior of the band and the intervals where it is attached to @xmath34 , as shown in figure  [ f : surgery ]    [ h ] @xmath181    ( so @xmath180 may have multiple boundary circles ) . the skein relations for the conway polynomial give rise to the following relations for @xmath179 : @xmath182 @xmath183    it is easy to show @xcite that this weight system satisfies the 2-term relations of section [ s:2term ] . simply surger the two chords ; the 2-term relation then says just that one band can be `` slid '' over the other , which does nt change the topology of the diagram . bar - natan and garoufalides also showed that the weight system for the conway polynomial for knots is just the determinant of the adjacency matrix for the intersection graph , mod 2 . the next theorem extends this result to string links with two components . [ t : conway2 ] for any chord diagram d on a string link with two components , @xmath184 ( mod 2 ) . proof : since both of these weight systems satisfy the 2-term relations , it suffices to show that they agree on diagrams in normal form ( see section [ ss : chord2term ] ) . for string links with two components , normal form consists of a caravan on the first component , and 0 , 1 , or 2 parallel chords between the two components . say that the caravan has @xmath101 1-humped camels and @xmath102 2-humped camels , and there are @xmath85 chords between the components ( @xmath185 ) . then @xmath186^l \\oplus [ 0]^{m_1 } \\oplus \\left[{\\matrix{0 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0}}\\right]^{m_2}$ ] . so @xmath187 ( mod 2 ) and @xmath188 ( mod 2 ) . the product of the rank and determinant is 1 ( mod 2 ) when @xmath189 and @xmath190 , and 0 otherwise . on the other hand , if we surger all the chords of the diagram , and close the string link , we obtain an unlink with @xmath191 components when @xmath192 , and @xmath193 when @xmath194 , which means that @xmath195 only when @xmath196 and @xmath194 . so the two weight systems agree . @xmath91    with more than two components , the situation is more complicated ; in fact , the conway weight system is not always determined by the adjacency matrix of the intersection graph . figure  [ f : counterexample ] shows two chord diagrams @xmath30 and @xmath31 on 4 components which illustrate this . [ h ] @xmath197    it is easy to see that these intersection graphs for these diagrams differ only in the labeling of the vertices , so :    @xmath198\\ ] ]    however , surgering the chords in @xmath30 yields a string link whose closure has one component , and surgering the chords in @xmath31 yields a string link whose closure has 3 components . therefore , @xmath199 , but @xmath200 . however , we can at least give a sufficient condition for @xmath201 to be trivial which depends only on the adjacency matrix . [ p : suff ] let d be a string link chord diagram of degree k on n components . if either of the following conditions holds , then c(d ) = 0 . * @xmath202 . * @xmath203 is even . proof : the first condition means that , in the normal form , there will be an isolated chord in the caravan , so @xmath201 will be trivial . the second condition comes from observing that every surgery of a chord in @xmath34 the number of components in the closure of @xmath34 by 1 ( either adding or removing a component ) . since we begin with @xmath12 components , the number of components after all the chords are surgered is congruent to @xmath203 modulo 2 . so @xmath201 can be non - trivial only if @xmath204 mod 2 . hence , if @xmath203 is even , then @xmath205 . @xmath91    now we will consider the ( framed ) homfly weight system for string links . the homfly invariant is the laurent polynomial @xmath206 $ ] defined by the following skein relations @xcite ( @xmath207 is the result of adding a positive kink to the link @xmath208 ) : @xmath209 @xmath210 @xmath211 @xmath212 if we make the substitutions @xmath213 and @xmath214 , and expand the resulting power series , we transform the homfly polynomial into a power series in @xmath215 , whose coefficients are finite type invariants ( of regular isotopy ) . these invariants give rise to regular weight systems which we can collect together as the homfly regular weight system @xmath81 . the skein relations above give rise to the following relations for @xmath81 , by looking at the first terms of the power series ( as before , @xmath180 is the result of surgering the chord @xmath10 in @xmath34 ) : @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 so if @xmath34 is an unlink of @xmath2 components , @xmath219 . since the first of these relations is almost the same as for the conway weight system @xmath179 , the same argument shows that @xmath81 satisfies the 2-term relations . we can now consider string link diagrams with two components ( as with the conway weight system , the homfly weight system is not necessarily determined by the adjacency matrix of the intersection graph for chord diagrams on more than two components ) . [ t : homfly2 ] for any chord diagram d of degree k on a string link with 2 components , let @xmath220 . if r is odd , then @xmath221 ; if r is even , then @xmath222 . proof : as with theorem [ t : conway2 ] , it suffices to show that the weight systems agree on diagrams in normal form . let @xmath34 be the diagram with @xmath101 one - humped camels and @xmath102 two - humped camels on component 1 , and @xmath85 chords between the two components ( @xmath185 ) ( so the degree of @xmath34 is @xmath223 ) . as before , @xmath186^l \\oplus [ 0]^{m_1 } \\oplus \\left[{\\matrix{0 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0}}\\right]^{m_2}$ ] , so the rank is @xmath224 . @xmath225 is even when @xmath192 and odd when @xmath194 .    on the other hand , if we surger all the chords ( each time multiplying @xmath81 by @xmath226 ) , the resulting link has @xmath191 components when @xmath192 ( and @xmath225 is even ) , and @xmath193 components when @xmath194 ( and @xmath225 is odd ) . so when @xmath225 is even , @xmath227 , and when @xmath225 is odd , @xmath228 . @xmath91 +   + remark : if we let @xmath229 and @xmath230 , then @xmath231 . according to theorem [ t : homfly2 ] , if @xmath34 is a string link chord diagram with two components , we will have @xmath232 in this case _ unless _ @xmath233 is odd ( in which case @xmath234 ) . but this is exactly the case when @xmath235 ( since the matrix has full rank ) and @xmath236 mod 2 , so @xmath195 . so the formulas for the conway and homfly weight systems agree in this case .", "there are several obvious questions and directions for further research . figure [ f : counterexample ] gives an example of chord diagrams on 4 components where the adjacency matrix of the intersection graph is insufficient to determine the conway and homfly weight systems . however , this example seems to depend strongly on there being 4 components - it is not clear how to find connected examples with , say , 5 components where the adjacency matrix is insufficient . and certainly the adjacency matrix ( as shown by the example in figure [ f : counterexample ] does not contain all the information of the intersection graph - in particular , the information contained in the vertex labels . this leads to our next question :            this question is still open for knots , as well , though some progress has been made @xcite . some work has been done by the author @xcite for the case when the intersection graph is a tree , but this is only a bare beginning .        10 bar -
